    "## Instructions\n",
    "Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other packages that we're importing are `project_helper` and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.\n",

      "control technologies for buildings, homes and industry, automotive products,\n",
      "specialty chemicals, fibers, plastics and electronic and advanced materials. As\n",

      "AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell Inc. in 1999. The following is a description of\n",
      "the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include\n",
      "the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries in\n",
      "which a controlling interest is maintained. All intercompany transactions and\n",
      "balances are eliminated in consolidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "    INVENTORIES -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using\n",
      "the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out\n",
      "(LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories.\n",
      "\n",
      "    INVESTMENTS -- Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant\n",
      "influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity\n",
      "method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily\n",
      "determinable, or cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to\n",
      "determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary.\n",
      "Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices and a series of\n",
      "historic and projected operating losses by investees are considered in the\n",
      "review. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary,\n",
      "an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new cost\n",
      "basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Property, plant and equipment are recorded\n",
      "at cost less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-\n",
      "line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to\n",
      "40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery\n",
      "and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "    GOODWILL -- Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the\n",
      "fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a\n",
      "straight-line basis over appropriate periods up to 40 years. Accumulated\n",

      "amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period benefited by future\n",
      "cash inflows up to 25 years. Accumulated amortization was $548 and $498 million\n",
      "at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.\n",

      "carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment,\n",
      "goodwill and other intangible assets) whenever events or changes in\n",
      "circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully\n",
      "recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future\n",
      "cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment\n",
      "losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset\n",
      "exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating earnings. We also\n",
      "continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and\n",
      "periodically revise such estimates based on current events.\n",
      "\n",
      "    SALES RECOGNITION -- Product and service sales are recognized when an\n",
      "agreement of sale exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been\n",
      "rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably\n",
      "assured. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and\n",

    "Without doing a full and formal backtest, we can analyze how stable the alphas are over time. Stability in this sense means that from period to period, the alpha ranks do not change much. Since trading is costly, we always prefer, all other things being equal, that the ranks do not change significantly per period. We can measure this with the **Factor Rank Autocorrelation (FRA)**."
