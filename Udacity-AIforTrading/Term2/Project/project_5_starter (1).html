/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a <code># TODO</code> comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our <code>project_tests</code> package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.</p>
<h2 id="Packages">Packages<a class="anchor-link" href="#Packages">&#182;</a></h2><p>When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a>. These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.</p>
<p>The other packages that we're importing are <code>project_helper</code> and <code>project_tests</code>. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The <code>project_helper</code> module contains utility functions and graph functions. The <code>project_tests</code> contains the unit tests for all the problems.</p>

<h3 id="Get-Documents">Get Documents<a class="anchor-link" href="#Get-Documents">&#182;</a></h3><p>With theses fillings downloaded, we want to break them into their associated documents. These documents are sectioned off in the fillings with the tags <code>&lt;DOCUMENT&gt;</code> for the start of each document and <code>&lt;/DOCUMENT&gt;</code> for the end of each document. There's no overlap with these documents, so each <code>&lt;/DOCUMENT&gt;</code> tag should come after the <code>&lt;DOCUMENT&gt;</code> with no <code>&lt;DOCUMENT&gt;</code> tag in between.</p>
<p>Implement <code>get_documents</code> to return a list of these documents from a filling. Make sure not to include the tag in the returned document text.</p>

AEROSPACE SALES

    Our sales to aerospace customers were 41, 40 and 42 percent of our total
sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our sales to aerospace original
equipment manufacturers were 15, 14 and 15 percent of our total sales in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. If there were a large decline in sales of aircraft
that use our components, operating results could be negatively impacted. In
addition, our sales to aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services
were 21, 21 and 19 percent of our total sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. If there were a large decline in the number of flight hours for
aircraft that use our components or services, operating results could be
negatively impacted. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 resulted in an
abrupt downturn in the aviation industry which was already negatively impacted
by a weak economy. This dramatic downturn in the commercial air transport
industry will continue to adversely impact the operating results of our
Aerospace segment in 2002. In response, we have accelerated our cost-reduction
actions to mitigate the impact of this downturn.

U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES

    Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace segment), acting
through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors,
amounted to $2,491, $2,219 and $2,383 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense of $1,631,
$1,548 and $1,415 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. We are affected
by U.S. Government budget constraints for defense and space programs. U.S.
defense spending increased in 2001 and is also expected to increase in 2002.

    In addition to normal business risks, companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual
risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design
improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry.
Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly
development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices.

    We, like other government contractors, are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations. Although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty, we are not currently aware of any such investigations that we expect,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on us. In
addition, we have a proactive business compliance program designed to ensure
compliance and sound business practices.

BACKLOG

    Our total backlog at year-end 2001 and 2000 was $7,178 and $8,094 million,
respectively. We anticipate that approximately $5,375 million of the 2001
backlog will be filled in 2002. We believe that

                                       7





&lt;Page&gt;

backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a
substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at
the customer&#39;s option.

COMPETITION

    We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions.
Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services
provided by us, and vary country by country. Depending on the particular
customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors,
such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance,
applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity,
service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for
our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other
competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line,
research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While
our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we
are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes.
However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with
those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial
financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition,
some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original
equipment manufacturers.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

    We are engaged in manufacturing, sales and research and development mainly
in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and
foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations.

    Our international operations, including U.S. exports, are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations, including: fluctuations in
currency value; exchange control regulations; wage and price controls;
employment regulations; foreign investment laws; import and trade restrictions,
including embargoes; and governmental instability. However, we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate these risks.

    Financial information related to geographic areas is included in &#39;Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 25 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

RAW MATERIALS

    The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available. We experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2001. We are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. However, we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers. In addition, many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies. We maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. While we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future. However, at present, we have no reason to believe a
shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2002.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

    Our business as a whole, and that of our strategic business units, are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or
distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents,
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many years, which
relate to many of our products or improvements to those products and which are
of importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are
obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others.
We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies. In our judgment, those rights are adequate
for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights
under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our
operations, but we do not consider any patent, trademark or related group of
patents, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a

                                       8





&lt;Page&gt;

specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our
total business. See Item 3 at page 10 of this Form 10-K for information
concerning litigation relating to patents in which we are involved.

    We have registered trademarks for a number of our products, including such
consumer brands as Honeywell, Prestone, FRAM, Anso and Autolite.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes, improvements in existing products and processes, and
the development of new uses for existing products.

    Research and development expense totaled $832, $818 and $909 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S.
Government) research and development activities amounted to an additional $697,
$560 and $682 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

    We are subject to various federal, state and local government requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these
requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with
our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of
our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses.

    We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our handling, manufacture, use
and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental laws and
regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other
developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies, could bring into question our handling, manufacture, use
or disposal of these substances.

    Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal
superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency&#39;s superfund priority list. Although, under some court
interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-
party situations taken as a whole.

    Further information regarding environmental matters is included in &#39;Item 7.
Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations&#39; and &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in
Note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES

    We have approximately 115,000 employees at December 31, 2001. Approximately
79,000 were located in the United States, and, of these employees, about 19
percent were unionized employees represented by various local or national
unions.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    We have over 1,000 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories,
sales offices and other facilities. Our plants are generally located to serve
large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor
pools. Our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business
conditions; however, no major operating facility is significantly idle. Our
facilities, together with planned expansions, are expected to meet our needs for
the foreseeable future. We own or lease warehouses, railroad cars, barges,
automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and data processing
equipment. We also

                                       9





&lt;Page&gt;

lease space for administrative and sales staffs. Our headquarters and
administrative complex is located at Morristown, New Jersey.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    On November 23, 2001, we agreed to pay a $110,000 penalty to the United
States and a $40,000 penalty to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to perform five
special environmental projects worth $772,000 to settle alleged violations of
federal and state environmental regulations at our plant in Hopewell, Virginia.
In an action filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, the state and federal
environmental protection agencies had alleged violations of the federal Clean
Air Act and federal and state regulations on the storage and disposal of
hazardous substances. In the settlement, we neither admitted nor denied
liability for the alleged violations.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Net sales in 2001 were $23,652 million, a decrease of $1,371 million, or
5 percent compared with 2000. Net sales in 2000 were $25,023 million, an
increase of $1,288 million, or 5 percent compared with 1999. The change in net
sales in 2001 and 2000 is attributable to the following:

    Cost of goods sold of $20,429, $19,090 and $18,495 million in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, included merger, repositioning and other charges of $2,438,
$830 and $947 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See &#39;Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 5 of Notes to Financial
Statements for further discussion of the merger, repositioning and other
charges. Excluding these charges, cost of goods sold was $17,991, $18,260 and
$17,548 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding merger,
repositioning and other charges, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was
76.1, 73.0 and 73.9 percent in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase
in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000
principally reflected significantly lower sales in our Specialty Materials
segment and lower sales of higher-margin aftermarket products and services in
our Aerospace segment. This increase was partially offset by lower costs due to
headcount reductions. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales
in 2000 compared with 1999 related principally to lower costs due to headcount
reductions and increased sales of higher-margin aftermarket products and
services in our Aerospace segment partially offset by higher raw materials
costs, primarily in our Specialty Materials segment.

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,064, $3,134 and $3,216
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Selling, general and
administrative expenses included merger, repositioning and other charges of $151
and $300 million in 2001 and 1999, respectively. See &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements
for further discussion of the merger, repositioning and other charges. Excluding
these charges, selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,913, $3,134
and $2,916 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding merger,
repositioning and other charges, selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percent of sales were 12.3, 12.5 and 12.3 percent in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000 principally reflected the impact of
headcount reductions and a decline in discretionary spending for professional
services, travel and overtime. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2000 compared with 1999
principally reflected our acquisition of Pittway, which had a higher level of
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.

    Retirement benefit (pension and other post retirement) plans contributed
cost reductions of $165, $282 and $61 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, principally due to the funding status of our pension plans
(described in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 23
of Notes to Financial Statements) and workforce reductions. Future effects on
operating results will principally depend on pension plan investment performance
and other economic conditions.

    (Gain) on sale of non-strategic businesses of $112 million in 2000
represented the pretax gain on the government-mandated divestiture of the TCAS
product line of Honeywell Inc. (the former Honeywell) in connection with the
merger of AlliedSignal Inc. and the former Honeywell in December 1999. (Gain) on
sale of non-strategic businesses of $106 million in 1999 represented the pretax
gain

                                       13





&lt;Page&gt;

on the sale of our Laminate Systems business. See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements for further
information.

    Equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies was a loss of $193 and $89
million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and income of $76 million in 1999.
Equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies included repositioning and other
charges of $200, $136 and $40 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See
&#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 5 of Notes to
Financial Statements for further discussion of the repositioning and other
charges. Excluding these charges, equity in (income) loss of affiliated
companies was income of $7, $47 and $116 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The decrease of $40 million in equity income in 2001 compared with
2000 was due mainly to the gain on the sale of our interest in an automotive
aftermarket joint venture in 2000. The decrease of $69 million in equity income
in 2000 compared with 1999 was due mainly to lower earnings from our UOP process
technology (UOP) joint venture partially offset by the gain on the sale of our
interest in an automotive aftermarket joint venture.

    Other (income) expense, $17 million of income in 2001, decreased by $40
million compared with 2000. The current year included a net provision of $5
million consisting of a $6 million charge related to the redemption of our $200
million 5 3/4% dealer remarketable securities and a $1 million credit recognized
upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
&#39;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#39;, as amended.
Excluding this net provision, other (income) expense was $22 million of income
in 2001, a decrease of $35 million compared with 2000 due to a decrease in
benefits from foreign exchange hedging and lower interest income, partially
offset by lower minority interests expense. Other (income) expense, $57 million
of income in 2000, decreased by $250 million compared with 1999. The decrease
principally reflected the 1999 net gain of $268 million on our disposition of
our investment in AMP common stock. Excluding this net gain, other (income)
expense was $57 million of income in 2000, compared with $39 million of income
in 1999. This increase in other income of $18 million in 2000 was due
principally to lower minority interests expense and an increase in benefits from
foreign exchange hedging.

    Interest and other financial charges of $405 million in 2001 decreased by
$76 million, or 16 percent compared with 2000, due to lower average debt
outstanding and lower average interest rates in 2001. Interest and other
financial charges of $481 million in 2000 increased by $216 million, or
82 percent compared with 1999. The increase resulted from higher average debt
outstanding during 2000 due principally to our acquisition of Pittway and our
share repurchase program, higher average interest rates and the impact of tax
interest expense.

    The effective tax (benefit) rate was (76.6), 30.8 and 31.5 percent in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding the impact of merger, repositioning and
other charges and gains on our sales of non-strategic businesses and our
investment in AMP, the effective tax rate was 29.5, 29.5 and 31.5 percent in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in
2000 compared with 1999 related principally to tax synergies in Europe
associated with the merger of AlliedSignal Inc. and the former Honeywell. See
&#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 9 of Notes to
Financial Statements for further information.

    Net loss was $99 million, or $(0.12) per share, in 2001 compared with net
income of $1,659 million, or $2.05 per share, in 2000. Adjusted for
repositioning and other charges, net income in 2001 was $1,771 million, or $2.17
per share higher than reported. Adjusted for repositioning and other charges and
the gain on the disposition of the TCAS product line of the former Honeywell,
net income in 2000 was $634 million, or $0.78 per share higher than reported.
Net income in 2001 decreased by 27 percent compared with 2000 if both years are
adjusted to exclude the impact of repositioning and other charges and the gain
on the disposition of the TCAS product line of the former Honeywell. Net income
was $1,659 million, or $2.05 per share, in 2000 compared with net income of
$1,541 million, or $1.90 per share, in 1999. Adjusted for the gains on our
dispositions of our Laminate Systems business and our investment in AMP and
merger, repositioning and other charges, net income in 1999 was $624 million, or
$0.78 per share, higher than reported. Net income in 2000 increased by
6 percent compared with 1999 if both years are adjusted for merger,
repositioning and other charges and the gains on our dispositions of the TCAS
product line of the former Honeywell, our Laminate Systems business and our
investment in AMP.

See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 24 of Notes to
Financial Statements for further information on our reportable segments.

    Aerospace sales in 2001 were $9,653 million, a decrease of $335 million, or
3 percent compared with 2000. This decrease principally reflected lower sales to
both commercial air transport aftermarket and original equipment customers and
the impact of prior year divestitures. Sales of original equipment to business
and general aviation customers were also lower. This decrease was partially
offset by higher aftermarket sales to business and general aviation customers.
Sales to the military were also moderately higher. The lower commercial sales
resulted from the abrupt downturn in the aviation industry following the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the already weak economy. This
dramatic downturn in the commercial air transport industry will continue to
negatively impact the operating results of our Aerospace segment in 2002. In
response, we have accelerated our cost-reduction actions to mitigate the impact
of this downturn. Aerospace sales in 2000 were $9,988 million, an increase of
$80 million, or 1 percent compared with 1999. Higher sales to the aftermarket,
particularly repair and overhaul and the military, and increased original
equipment sales to business and general aviation customers were partially offset
by lower sales to commercial air transport original equipment customers and a
decline in engineering services revenues. Sales also decreased due to the
effects of government-mandated divestitures in connection with the merger of
AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell.

    Aerospace segment profit in 2001 was $1,741 million, a decrease of $454
million, or 21 percent compared with 2000. This decrease related principally to
lower sales of higher-margin aftermarket products, higher retirement benefit
costs, engineering and development costs related to new products and the impact
of prior year divestitures. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of
cost-

                                       15





&lt;Page&gt;

reduction actions, primarily workforce reductions. Aerospace segment profit in
2000 was $2,195 million, an increase of $277 million, or 14 percent compared
with 1999, due principally to cost-structure improvements, primarily from
workforce and retirement benefit cost reductions, and merger-related savings.
Increased sales of higher-margin aftermarket products and services also
contributed to the improvement in segment profit.

    Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2001 were $7,185 million, a
decrease of $199 million, or 3 percent compared with 2000. Excluding the impact
of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, sales decreased
approximately 2 percent. This decrease resulted primarily from lower sales for
our Control Products business primarily due to weakness in key end-markets. Our
Service business also had lower sales due primarily to weakness in our security
monitoring business. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales for our
Industry Solutions business. Sales were also higher for our Security and Fire
Solutions business due principally to our acquisition of Pittway in the prior
year. Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2000 were $7,384 million, an
increase of $1,269 million, or 21 percent compared with 1999, due principally to
higher sales for our Security and Fire Solutions business due to our acquisition
of Pittway in February 2000. Sales for our Control Products business also
increased. This increase was partially offset by lower sales in our Service and
Industry Solutions businesses. Our Industry Solutions business was adversely
affected by weakness in the hydrocarbon processing industry. Sales for the
segment were also adversely impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the
strong dollar.

    Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2001 was $819 million, a
decrease of $167 million, or 17 percent compared with 2000. This decrease
resulted principally from lower sales for our Control Products and Service
businesses, higher raw material costs and pricing pressures across the segment,
higher retirement benefit costs and the impact of prior year divestitures. This
decrease was partially offset by the impact of cost-reduction actions, primarily
workforce reductions. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2000
was $986 million, an increase of $219 million, or 29 percent compared with 1999.
Segment profit improved primarily as a result of lower costs due to workforce
and benefit cost reductions and merger-related savings. Our acquisition of
Pittway and other portfolio changes also contributed to the improvement in
segment profit.

    Specialty Materials sales in 2001 were $3,313 million, a decrease of $742
million, or 18 percent compared with 2000. Excluding the effect of divestitures,
sales decreased 13 percent. This decrease was driven by a substantial decline in
sales for our Electronic Materials business due to weakness in the electronics
and telecommunications markets. Sales were also lower for our Nylon System and
Performance Fibers businesses due to weakness in the carpet and automotive
end-markets. Specialty Materials sales in 2000 were $4,055 million, an increase
of $48 million, or 1 percent compared with 1999. Higher sales of advanced
circuitry and wafer-fabrication products were largely offset by the impact of
divestitures, principally our Laminate Systems business.

    Specialty Materials segment profit in 2001 was $52 million, a decrease of
$282 million, or 84 percent compared with 2000. This decrease resulted primarily
from lower volumes and price declines, principally in our Electronic Materials,
Nylon System and Performance Fibers businesses. Higher energy and raw material
costs principally in our Nylon System and Performance Fibers businesses and the
impact of prior year divestitures also contributed to the decrease in segment
profit. By the end of 2001, we began to experience lower energy and raw
materials costs in these businesses. This decrease in segment profit was
partially offset by the impact of cost-reduction actions, principally plant
shutdowns and workforce reductions. Specialty Materials segment profit in 2000
was $334 million, a decrease of $105 million, or 24 percent compared with 1999.
This decrease principally reflected higher energy and raw material costs
primarily in our Nylon System and Performance Fibers businesses and higher
operating losses in our chip packaging and pharmaceutical chemicals businesses.
This decrease was partially offset by cost-structure improvements and price
increases in certain Specialty Materials businesses.

    Transportation and Power Systems sales in 2001 were $3,457 million, a
decrease of $70 million, or 2 percent compared with 2000. Excluding the effects
of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, sales were flat. Sales were
significantly higher for our Garrett Engine Boosting Systems business due to
continued strong demand for turbochargers in the European diesel-powered

                                       16





&lt;Page&gt;

passenger car market. This increase was offset by lower sales for our Bendix
Commercial Vehicle Systems business due to decreased heavy-duty truck builds in
North America and lower sales for our Friction Materials and Consumer Products
Group businesses due to weakness in automotive end-markets. Transportation and
Power Systems sales in 2000 were $3,527 million, a decrease of $54 million, or
2 percent compared with 1999 due mainly to lower sales for our Bendix Commercial
Vehicle Systems and Friction Materials businesses. Sales for our Bendix
Commercial Vehicles Systems business were negatively impacted by decreased
heavy-duty truck builds. Sales for our Friction Materials business were lower
mainly due to foreign currency fluctuations. This decrease was partially offset
by higher sales for our Garrett Engine Boosting Systems business as continued
strong world-wide demand for turbochargers more than offset the adverse impact
of foreign currency fluctuations.

    Transportation and Power Systems segment profit in 2001 was $289 million, an
increase of $15 million, or 5 percent compared with 2000 due to higher sales in
our Garrett Engine Boosting Systems business and the impact of repositioning
actions across all businesses. The shutdown of our Turbogenerator product line
in 2001 and the fact that the prior year included costs associated with a
product recall in our Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems business also
contributed to an improvement in segment profit in 2001. This increase was
partially offset by the impact of lower sales in our Bendix Commercial Vehicle
Systems, Consumer Products Group and Friction Materials businesses.
Transportation and Power Systems segment profit in 2000 was $274 million, a
decrease of $48 million, or 15 percent compared with 1999. This decrease
primarily reflected costs associated with a product recall and lower sales in
our Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems business, costs related to the ramp-up of
our Turbogenerator product line and costs associated with a supplier issue in
our Garrett Engine Boosting Systems business. This decrease was partially offset
by the effects of cost-structure improvements in our Friction Materials and
Consumer Products Group businesses and higher sales in our Garrett Engine
Boosting Systems business.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    We manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the principal
source of our liquidity. We continuously assess the relative strength of each
business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash
flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify
business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify
acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our
existing core businesses. We also identify business units that do not fit into
our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative
profitability or growth potential. These business units are considered for
potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to
regulatory constraints. Considering the current economic environment in which
each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies, including
our focus on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that our
operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity. Our
available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt markets using
debt securities and commercial paper, as well as, our ability to sell trade
accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term
liquidity to fund current operations and future investment opportunities. Based
on our current financial position and expected economic performance, we do not
believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access
our sources of financing.

    Total assets at December 31, 2001 were $24,226 million, a decrease of $949
million, or 4 percent from December 31, 2000. Inventories and accounts
receivable were lower compared with the prior year-end driven by an improvement
in working capital performance. The decrease in total assets also resulted from
asset writedowns included in repositioning and other charges, which are
discussed in detail in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in
Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements. Total assets at December 31, 2000 were
$25,175 million, an increase of $1,648 million, or 7 percent from December 31,
1999. This increase related principally to our acquisition of Pittway in
February 2000.

    Cash provided by operating activities of $1,996 million during 2001
increased by $7 million compared with 2000. This increase was driven by an
improvement in working capital performance offset by lower net income excluding
non-cash repositioning and other charges and gains on sales of

                                       17

non-strategic businesses in both years. Cash provided by operating activities of
$1,989 million during 2000 decreased by $385 million compared with 1999 due
principally to spending related to merger and repositioning actions, a
deterioration in working capital performance and higher pension income. This
decrease was partially offset by lower taxes paid on sales of businesses and
investments and higher net income excluding non-cash merger, repositioning and
other charges and gains on sales of non-strategic businesses and our investment
in AMP in both years.

    Cash used for investing activities of $906 million during 2001 decreased by
$1,808 million compared with 2000 due principally to our acquisition of Pittway
in 2000. This decrease was partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of
businesses and property, plant and equipment and a slight increase in capital
spending. Cash used for investing activities of $2,714 million during 2000
increased by $2,423 million compared with 1999. Our acquisition of Pittway, the
fact that the prior year included the net proceeds from our disposition of our
investment in AMP and lower proceeds from sales of businesses were principally
responsible for the increase. This increase was partially offset by lower
capital spending in 2000.

    Capital expenditures were $876, $853 and $986 million in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Spending by the reportable segments and Corporate since 1999
is shown in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 24 of
Notes to Financial Statements. Our total capital expenditures in 2002 are
currently projected at approximately $735 million. The expected decrease in
capital spending in 2002 principally reflects our intention to limit capital
spending at non-strategic businesses. These expenditures are expected to be
financed principally by cash provided by operating activities and are primarily
intended for expansion and cost reduction.

    Cash used for financing activities of $893 million during 2001 increased by
$823 million compared with 2000. This increase resulted principally from reduced
long-term borrowings in the current year. During 2001, we issued $500 million of
5 1/8% Notes due 2006, $500 million of 6 1/8% Notes due 2011 and $247 million of
5.25% Notes due 2006. During 2000, we issued $1 billion of 7.50% Notes due 2010
and $750 million of 6.875% Notes due 2005. Total debt of $5,270 million at
December 31, 2001 was $353 million, or 6 percent lower than at December 31,
2000. This decrease resulted from lower levels of commercial paper outstanding
at the current year-end. The increase in cash used for financing activities also
resulted from lower proceeds from issuances of common stock partially offset by
lower repurchases of common stock. Cash used for financing activities of $70
million during 2000 decreased by $1,040 million compared with 1999 led
principally by a decrease in stock repurchases and higher net issuances of debt.
During 2000, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $166
million in connection with our share repurchase program which was rescinded
effective October 21, 2000. Total debt of $5,623 million at December 31, 2000
was $557 million, or 11 percent higher than at December 31, 1999 due to our
acquisition of Pittway.

    We maintain a $2 billion bank revolving credit facility which is comprised
of (a) a $1 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement; and, (b) a $1 billion 364-Day
Credit Agreement. The credit agreements were established for general corporate
purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper. There was $3
and $1,192 million of commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2001 and 2000,
respectively. See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in
Note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements for details of long-term debt and a
discussion of our credit agreements.

    Following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial
commitments at December 31, 2001.

    We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings.
Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years and
some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during
the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets
for amounts that approximate fair value. If we elect not to purchase the assets
at the end of each such lease, we have guaranteed the residual values of the
underlying assets (principally aircraft, equipment, buildings and land). We have
also issued or are party to various direct and indirect guarantees of the debt
of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties. The minimum operating lease
payments, residual value guarantees, and maximum amount of unconsolidated
affiliates and third party guarantees are reflected in the above table. We do
not expect that any of our commercial commitments will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

MERGER, REPOSITIONING AND OTHER CHARGES

    In 2001, we recognized a repositioning charge of $1,016 million for the
cost of actions designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our future
profitability. These actions consisted of announced global workforce reductions
of approximately 20,000 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of
our reportable segments of which approximately 15,000 positions have been
eliminated as of December 31, 2001. These actions are expected to be completed
by September 30, 2002. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments
and other exit costs related to plant closures and the rationalization of
manufacturing capacity and infrastructure, principally in our Specialty
Materials, Engines, Systems and Services and Transportation and Power Systems
businesses, including the shutdown of our Turbogenerator product line. The
components of the charge included severance costs of $727 million, asset
impairments of $194 million and other exit costs of $95 million consisting of
contract cancellations and penalties, including lease terminations, negotiated
or subject to reasonable estimation. Also, $119 million of previously
established accruals, mainly for severance, were returned to income in 2001 due
principally to higher than expected voluntary employee attrition resulting in
reduced severance liabilities, principally in our Aerospace and Automation and
Control Solutions reportable segments.

    In 2000, we recognized a repositioning charge of $239 million related to
announced global workforce reductions across all of our reportable segments,
costs to close a chip package manufacturing plant and related workforce
reductions, and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shut-downs in our Specialty Materials
reportable segment. The components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of $151 million and asset impairments of $88 million. The
announced workforce reductions consisted of approximately 2,800 manufacturing
and administrative positions, which are complete. Asset impairments were
principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and
capable of being taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of
impairment. Also, $46 million of previously established accruals, principally
for severance, were returned to income in 2000 due to higher than expected
voluntary employee attrition resulting in reduced severance liabilities,
principally in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace reportable
segments. We also recognized a repositioning charge of $99 million in equity in
(income) loss of affiliated companies for costs to close an affiliate&#39;s chemical
manufacturing operations. The components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of $6 million, asset impairments of $53 million, and other
environmental exit costs and period expenses of $40 million.

                                       19





&lt;Page&gt;

    In 1999, upon completion of the merger between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell, we recognized a repositioning charge of $642 million for the cost of
actions designed to improve our combined competitiveness, productivity and
future profitability. The merger-related actions included the elimination of
redundant corporate offices and functional administrative overhead; elimination
of redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses; adoption of Six Sigma productivity initiatives at the former
Honeywell businesses; and, the transition to a global shared services model. The
components of the repositioning charge included severance costs of $342 million,
asset impairments of $108 million, other exit costs of $57 million and
merger-related transaction and period expenses of $135 million. Global workforce
reductions consisted of approximately 6,500 administrative and manufacturing
positions, which are complete. Asset impairments were principally related to the
elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace facilities and
equipment. Other exit costs were related to lease terminations and contract
cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation at year-end.
Merger-related transaction and period expenses consisted of investment banking
and legal fees, former Honeywell deferred compensation vested upon change in
control and other direct merger-related expenses incurred in the period the
merger was completed. All merger-related actions are complete.

    In 1999, we also recognized a repositioning charge of $321 million for the
cost of actions designed to reposition principally the AlliedSignal businesses
for improved productivity and future profitability. These actions included the
organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to strengthen market
focus and simplify business structure; elimination of an unprofitable product
line, closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant and rationalization
of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our Specialty Materials
reportable segment; a reduction in the infrastructure in our Garrett Engine
Boosting Systems business; elimination of two manufacturing facilities in our
Electronic Materials business; a plant closure and outsourcing activity in our
automotive Consumer Products Group business; and related and general workforce
reductions in all AlliedSignal businesses and our Automation and Control
Solutions reportable segment. The components of the repositioning charge
included severance costs of $140 million, asset impairments of $149 million, and
other exit costs of $32 million. Global workforce reductions consisted of
approximately 5,100 manufacturing, administrative, and sales positions, which
are complete. Asset impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant
and equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and
actively marketed in the period of impairment. Other exit costs principally
consisted of environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant shutdowns.
All repositioning actions, excluding environmental remediation, are complete.

    These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax
savings of approximately $760 million in 2002 compared with 2001 principally
from planned workforce reductions and facility consolidations. Cash expenditures
for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute these actions were $422
and $344 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such expenditures for severance
and other exit costs have been funded through operating cash flows, proceeds
from sales of non-strategic businesses and government required divestitures
resulting from the merger of AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell, and sale of
merger-related, excess or duplicate facilities and equipment. Cash expenditures
for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining 2001
actions will approximate $500 million in 2002 and will be funded principally
through operating cash flows.

    In 2001, we recognized other charges consisting of a settlement of the
Litton Systems, Inc. litigation for $440 million (see &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements
for further discussion), probable and reasonably estimable legal and
environmental claims of $408 million (see &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements for further
discussion), customer claims and settlements of contract liabilities of $310
million and write-offs principally related to asset impairments, including
receivables and inventories, of $335 million. In 2001, we adopted a plan to
dispose of our Friction Materials business and held discussions with a potential
acquiror of the business. The Friction Materials business was designated as held
for disposal, and we recognized an impairment charge of $145 million related to
the write-down of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable
intangible assets to their fair value less costs to sell. We recognized charges
of $112 million related to an other than temporary decline in the value of an
equity investment and an equity investee&#39;s loss

                                       20





&lt;Page&gt;

contract, and a $100 million charge for write-off of investments, including
inventory, related to a regional jet engine contract cancellation. We also
recognized $42 million of transaction expenses related to the proposed merger
with GE and redeemed our $200 million 5 3/4% dealer remarketable securities due
2011, resulting in a loss of $6 million.

    In 2000, we identified certain business units and manufacturing facilities
as non-core to our business strategy. As a result of this assessment, we
implemented cost reduction initiatives and conducted discussions with potential
acquirors of these businesses and assets. As part of this process, we evaluated
the businesses and assets for possible impairment. As a result of our analysis,
we recognized impairment charges in 2000 of $245 and $165 million principally
related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets of our Friction Materials business and a chemical
manufacturing facility, respectively. We recognized other charges consisting of
probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities of $87 million, and
contract claims, merger-related period expenses, other contingencies, and
write-offs of tangible assets removed from service, including inventory,
totaling $140 million. In addition, we recognized a charge of $37 million for
costs principally related to an equity investee&#39;s customer claims.

    In 1999, we recognized other charges consisting of losses on aerospace
engine maintenance contracts and a contract cancellation penalty totaling $45
million, customer and employee claims of $69 million, contract settlements and
contingent liabilities of $18 million, and other write-offs principally related
to tangible and intangible assets removed from service, including inventory, of
$152 million. We also recognized a $36 million charge resulting from an other
than temporary decline in value of an equity investment due to a significant
deterioration in market conditions and a $4 million charge related to an equity
investee&#39;s severance action involving approximately 220 employees.

    The following table summarizes the pretax impact of total merger,
repositioning and other charges by reportable business segment.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    We are subject to various federal, state and local government requirements
relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. We
believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are
properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and
personal injury to our employees and employees of our customers and that our
handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in
accord with environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past
operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies
engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary
cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims
associated with environmental matters, including past production of products
containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving
environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.

    With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we
continually conduct studies, individually at our owned sites, and jointly as a
member of industry groups at non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. With respect to
environmental matters involving the production of products containing toxic
substances, we believe that the costs of defending and resolving such matters
will be largely covered by insurance, subject to deductibles, exclusions,
retentions and policy limits. It is our policy (see &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements)
to record appropriate liabilities

                                       21





&lt;Page&gt;

for environmental matters when environmental assessments are made or remedial
efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. With respect to site contamination, the timing of these accruals is
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies. We expect that we
will be able to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow.
The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the
timing of litigation and settlements of personal injury and property damage
claims, insurance recoveries, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.

    Remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were $82, $75 and $78
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are currently estimated to be
approximately $77 million in 2002. We expect that we will be able to fund such
expenditures from operating cash flow.

    Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax
earnings were $152, $110 and $23 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the recorded liability for environmental matters
was $456 and $386 million, respectively. In addition, in 2001 and 2000 we
incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $75 and $80
million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations.

    Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations. However,
considering our past experience, insurance coverage and reserves, we do not
expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position.

    See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 5 of Notes
to Financial Statements for a discussion of our legal and environmental charges
and in Note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our
commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters
and toxic tort litigation.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial
position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate
and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing
activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial
instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other
speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.
A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is
included in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 1 of
Notes to Financial Statements.

    We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of
foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency
exchange rates arises from international financing activities between
subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and
anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to
preserve the economic value of cash flows in non-functional currencies. We
attempt to have all transaction exposures hedged with natural offsets to the
fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted,
through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our
principal currency exposures relate to the Euro countries, the British pound,
the Canadian dollar, and the U.S. dollar.

    Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our debt obligations. As described in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data&#39; in Notes 16 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements, we
issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage
our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs.

    Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty
credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk
through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties,
and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are

                                       22





&lt;Page&gt;

substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using
such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.

    The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for
interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate

The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated
changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are
forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market
conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these
estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets.
The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be
considered projections of future events.

OTHER MATTERS

LITIGATION

    See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of
Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of litigation matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and
subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies.
&#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary

                                       23





&lt;Page&gt;

Data&#39; in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements contains a detailed summary of
our significant accounting policies. We believe that a number of our accounting
policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of
operations. Following is a summary of those accounting policies that we believe
are our critical accounting policies, the judgments and uncertainties affecting
the application of those policies, and the likelihood that materially different
amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions.

    SALES RECOGNITION -- Product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and
Control Solutions segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method
measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the
units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for
anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses
become evident.

    We apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are
consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions. Upon
recognizing long-term contract sales, judgment must be applied to ensure that
anticipated losses are properly recognized in the period that they become
evident. Long-term contract loss experience is dependent upon the economic
health of our customers who are principally in the Aerospace and Automation and
Control segments, as well as our ability to estimate contract cost inputs and
perform according to contract terms and conditions. We believe that all relevant
conditions and assumptions are considered when recognizing sales and contract
losses.

    ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES -- We are subject to a number of
lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar
amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations. These
contingencies relate to commercial transactions, government contracts, product
liabilities, and environmental health and safety matters. As enumerated in &#39;Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Notes 1 and 22 of Notes to
Financial Statements, we recognize a liability for any contingency that is
probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable based on our judgment. Although
it is impossible to predict the outcome of any lawsuit, investigation or claim,
&#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of Notes to
Financial Statements provides a summary of all material contingencies currently
pending against us and our expectations related to the financial outcome of each
contingency.

    LONG-LIVED ASSETS (INCLUDING TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL) --
To conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy, we acquire
tangible and intangible assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of
the carrying amount of our long-lived assets (including property, plant and
equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating earnings. We continually
apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the
timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess
impairments, and the fair value of an impaired asset. The dynamic economic
environment in which each of our businesses operate and the resulting
assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of all
impairment tests.

    PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS -- We maintain pension plans
covering a majority of our employees and retirees, and postretirement benefit
plans for retirees that include health care benefits and life insurance coverage
(see &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 23 of Notes
to Financial Statements for additional details). For financial reporting
purposes, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (income)
are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount
rate for plan obligations, assumed rate of return on pension plan assets,
assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees, and an annual
rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare
benefits. Each of these assumptions is based upon our judgment, considering all
known trends and uncertainties. Actual asset returns for our pension plans
significantly below our assumed rate of return would result in lower

                                       24





&lt;Page&gt;

net periodic pension income (or higher expense) in future years. Actual annual
rates of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare
benefits above assumed rates of increase would result in higher net periodic
postretirement benefit costs in future years.

EURO CONVERSION

    On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
European Union&#39;s common currency (Euro). The transition period for the
introduction of the Euro was between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. We are
ensuring that Euro conversion compliance issues are addressed and do not expect
any adverse consequences.

SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

    Sales to the U.S. Government, acting through its various departments and
agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $2,491, $2,219 and $2,383
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This included sales to the
Department of Defense (DoD), as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $1,631,
$1,548 and $1,415 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Sales to the DoD
accounted for 6.9, 6.2 and 6.0 percent of our total sales in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. We are affected by U.S. Government budget constraints for
defense and space programs. U.S. defense spending increased in 2001 and is also
expected to increase in 2002.

BACKLOG

    Our total backlog at year-end 2001 and 2000 was $7,178 and $8,094 million,
respectively. We anticipate that approximately $5,375 million of the 2001
backlog will be filled in 2002. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer&#39;s option.

INFLATION

    Highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflation&#39;s impact on
the selling prices of our products and the costs of our purchased materials.
Cost increases for materials and labor have generally been low, and productivity
enhancement programs, including Six Sigma initiatives, have largely offset any
impact.

                          HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. is a diversified technology and manufacturing
company, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services,
control technologies for buildings, homes and industry, automotive products,
specialty chemicals, fibers, plastics and electronic and advanced materials. As
described in Note 2, Honeywell International Inc. was formed upon the merger of
AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell Inc. in 1999. The following is a description of
the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International Inc.

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries in
which a controlling interest is maintained. All intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation.

    INVENTORIES -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using
the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories.

    INVESTMENTS -- Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant
influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily
determinable, or cost. All equity investments are periodically reviewed to
determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other-than-temporary.
Significant and sustained decreases in quoted market prices and a series of
historic and projected operating losses by investees are considered in the
review. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary,
an impairment loss is recorded and the investment is written down to a new cost
basis.

    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-
line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery
and equipment.

    GOODWILL -- Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over appropriate periods up to 40 years. Accumulated
amortization was $1,148 and $974 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

    OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS -- Other intangible assets include investments in
long-term contracts, patents, trademarks, customer lists and other items
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period benefited by future
cash inflows up to 25 years. Accumulated amortization was $548 and $498 million
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    LONG-LIVED ASSETS -- We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the
carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment,
goodwill and other intangible assets) whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating earnings. We also
continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and
periodically revise such estimates based on current events.

    SALES RECOGNITION -- Product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace and Automation and
Control Solutions segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method
measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the
units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for
anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such
losses become evident.

                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

    ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES -- Environmental expenditures that relate to
current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not
provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally no
later than the completion of feasibility studies. The liabilities for
environmental costs recorded in Accrued Liabilities and Other Liabilities at
December 31, 2001 were $81 and $375 million, respectively, and at December 31,
2000 were $171 and $215 million, respectively.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -- Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S.
dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates effective during
the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of Accumulated Other Nonowner Changes. For subsidiaries operating in
highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment,
including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the
date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these
operations are included in earnings.

    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES -- Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, &#39;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&#39;, as amended (SFAS No. 133), is effective January 1, 2001. Under SFAS
No. 133, all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of
the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the
derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes
in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated Other Nonowner
Changes and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact
income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and
the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recorded in current earnings.

    Our adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative
effect adjustment of $1 million of income that is included in Other (Income)
Expense. This accounting change impacts only the pattern and timing of non-cash
accounting recognition for derivatives and did not significantly impact 2001
operating results.

    TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- Sales, transfers and securitization of
financial instruments are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 140, &#39;Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.&#39; We sell interests in designated pools of
trade accounts receivables to a third party. The receivables are removed from
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time they are sold. The value assigned to
undivided interests retained in trade receivables sold is based on the relative
fair values of the interests retained and sold. The carrying value of the
retained interests approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the
receivable collection period.

    INCOME TAXES -- Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary
differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax
reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax
rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A
valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which
realization is not likely.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- Research and development costs for company-
sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such
costs are classified as part of Cost of Goods Sold and were $832, $818 and
$909 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    EARNINGS PER SHARE -- Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based
on the weighted average number of

common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.
All earnings per share data in this report reflect earnings per share --
assuming dilution, unless otherwise indicated.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand
and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.

    USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial
statements and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically
reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.

    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS -- In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, &#39;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#39; (SFAS No.
144), the provisions of which are effective for us on January 1, 2002. SFAS No.
144 provides guidance on the accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 144
will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and
financial position.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, &#39;Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations&#39; (SFAS No. 143), the
provisions of which are effective for us on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 143
requires entities to recognize the fair value of a liability for tangible
long-lived asset retirement obligations in the period incurred, if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently evaluating the effect that
the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 143 will have on our consolidated
results of operations and financial position.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, &#39;Business Combinations&#39; (SFAS No. 141), and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, &#39;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#39; (SFAS
No. 142). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method only and that certain
acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets
apart from goodwill. We adopted SFAS No. 141 in 2001, which did not have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial
condition. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and certain other intangible
assets having indefinite lives no longer be amortized to income, but instead be
replaced with periodic testing for impairment. Intangible assets determined to
have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The
amortization and non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 have been applied
to any goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect
to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we are
required to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. We are currently
evaluating the effect, if any, of the application of the goodwill impairment
provisions of SFAS No. 142 on our consolidated results of operations and
financial condition. In 2001, amortization expense for goodwill and other
intangible assets having indefinite lives was approximately $196 million after
tax, or $0.24 per share.

    RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

NOTE 2 -- ALLIEDSIGNAL - HONEYWELL MERGER

    On December 1, 1999, AlliedSignal Inc. (AlliedSignal) and Honeywell Inc.
(former Honeywell) completed a merger under an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(Merger Agreement) dated as of June 4, 1999. Under the Merger Agreement, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AlliedSignal merged with and into the former
Honeywell. As a result of the merger, the former Honeywell became a wholly-owned

                                       32





&lt;Page&gt;

                          HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

subsidiary of AlliedSignal. At the effective time of the merger AlliedSignal was
renamed Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell).

    The former Honeywell shareowners received 1.875 shares of Honeywell common
stock for each share of the former Honeywell common stock with cash paid in lieu
of any fractional shares. As a result, former Honeywell shareowners received
approximately 241 million shares of Honeywell common stock valued at
approximately $15 billion at the merger date. In addition, outstanding former
Honeywell employee stock options were converted at the same exchange factor into
options to purchase approximately 10 million shares of Honeywell common stock.

    The merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization and was accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. Accordingly, Honeywell&#39;s
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to
the merger to include the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of the former Honeywell as though it had always been a part of Honeywell.

    There were no material transactions between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell prior to the merger, and there were no material adjustments to conform
the accounting policies of the combining companies.

    The net sales and net income previously reported by the separate companies
and the combined amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations were as follows:

&lt;/Table&gt;

    As described in Note 5, fees and expenses related to the merger and costs to
integrate the combined companies were expensed in the fourth quarter of 1999.

NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITIONS

    In addition to the pooling-of-interests transaction discussed in Note 2, we
acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $122, $2,646 and $1,314 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The following table presents information
about the more significant acquisitions (there were no significant acquisitions
in 2001):

(1) Pittway Corporation designs, manufactures and distributes security and fire
    systems for homes and buildings.

(2) Johnson Matthey Electronics supplies wafer fabrication materials and
    interconnect products to the electronics and telecommunications industries.

(3) TriStar Aerospace Co. distributes fasteners, fastening systems and related
    hardware and provides customized inventory management services to original
    equipment manufacturers of aircraft and aircraft components, commercial
    airlines and aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities.

    All the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of
acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
net assets acquired, of $42, $1,678 and $678 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over estimated
useful lives. In connection with these acquisitions the amounts recorded for
transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into
Honeywell were not material. The results of operations of the acquired
businesses have been included in the consolidated results of Honeywell from
their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma results for 2001, 2000 and
1999, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year,
would not be materially different from reported results.

NOTE 4 -- HONEYWELL-GENERAL ELECTRIC MERGER

    On October 22, 2000, Honeywell and General Electric Company (GE) entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) providing for a business
combination between Honeywell and GE. On July 3, 2001, the European Commission
issued its decision prohibiting the proposed merger. Approval by the European
Commission was a condition for completion of the merger. On October 2, 2001,
Honeywell and GE terminated the Merger Agreement by mutual consent and released
each other from claims arising out of the Merger Agreement.

NOTE 5 -- MERGER, REPOSITIONING AND OTHER CHARGES

    In 2001, we recognized a repositioning charge of $1,016 million for the
cost of actions designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our future
profitability. These actions consisted of announced global workforce reductions
of approximately 20,000 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of
our reportable segments of which approximately 15,000 positions have been
eliminated as of December 31, 2001. These actions are expected to be completed
by September 30, 2002. The repositioning charge also included asset impairments
and other exit costs related to plant closures and the rationalization of
manufacturing capacity and infrastructure, principally in our Specialty
Materials, Engines, Systems and Services and Transportation and Power Systems
businesses, including the shutdown of our Turbogenerator product line. The
components of the charge included severance costs of $727 million, asset
impairments of $194 million and other exit costs of $95 million consisting of
contract cancellations and penalties, including lease terminations, negotiated
or subject to reasonable estimation. Also, $119 million of previously
established accruals, mainly for severance, were returned to income in 2001 due
principally to higher than expected voluntary employee attrition resulting in
reduced severance liabilities, principally in our Aerospace and Automation and
Control Solutions reportable segments.

    In 2000, we recognized a repositioning charge of $239 million related to
announced global workforce reductions across all of our reportable segments,
costs to close a chip package manufacturing plant and related workforce
reductions, and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shut-downs in our Specialty Materials

reportable segment. The components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of $151 million and asset impairments of $88 million. The
announced workforce reductions consisted of approximately 2,800 manufacturing
and administrative positions, which are complete. Asset impairments were
principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and
capable of being taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of
impairment. Also, $46 million of previously established accruals, principally
for severance, were returned to income in 2000 due to higher than expected
voluntary employee attrition resulting in reduced severance liabilities,
principally in our Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace reportable
segments. We also recognized a repositioning charge of $99 million in equity in
(income) loss of affiliated companies for costs to close an affiliate&#39;s chemical
manufacturing operations. The components of the repositioning charge included
severance costs of $6 million, asset impairments of $53 million, and other
environmental exit costs and period expenses of $40 million.

    In 1999, upon completion of the merger between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell, we recognized a repositioning charge of $642 million for the cost of
actions designed to improve our combined competitiveness, productivity and
future profitability. The merger-related actions included the elimination of
redundant corporate offices and functional administrative overhead; elimination
of redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses; adoption of Six Sigma productivity initiatives at the former
Honeywell businesses; and, the transition to a global shared services model. The
components of the repositioning charge included severance costs of
$342 million, asset impairments of $108 million, other exit costs of
$57 million and merger-related transaction and period expenses of $135 million.
Global workforce reductions consisted of approximately 6,500 administrative and
manufacturing positions, which are complete. Asset impairments were principally
related to the elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace
facilities and equipment. Other exit costs were related to lease terminations
and contract cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation
at year-end. Merger-related transaction and period expenses consisted of
investment banking and legal fees, former Honeywell deferred compensation vested
upon change in control and other direct merger-related expenses incurred in the
period the merger was completed. All merger-related actions are complete.

    In 1999, we also recognized a repositioning charge of $321 million for the
cost of actions designed to reposition principally the AlliedSignal businesses
for improved productivity and future profitability. These repositioning actions
included the organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to
strengthen market focus and simplify business structure; elimination of an
unprofitable product line, closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant
and rationalization of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our
Specialty Materials reportable segment; a reduction in the infrastructure in our
Garrett Engine Boosting Systems business; elimination of two manufacturing
facilities in our Electronic Materials business; a plant closure and outsourcing
activity in our automotive Consumer Products Group business; and related and
general workforce reductions in all AlliedSignal businesses and our Automation
and Control Solutions reportable segment. The components of the repositioning
charge included severance costs of $140 million, asset impairments of
$149 million, and other exit costs of $32 million. Global workforce reductions
consisted of approximately 5,100 manufacturing, administrative, and sales
positions, which are complete. Asset impairments were principally related to
manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out
of service and actively marketed in the period of impairment. Other exit costs
principally consisted of environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant
shutdowns. All repositioning actions, excluding environmental remediation, are
complete.

    In 2001, we recognized other charges consisting of a settlement of the
Litton Systems, Inc. litigation for $440 million (see Note 22 for further
discussion), probable and reasonably estimable legal and environmental claims of
$408 million (see Note 22 for further discussion), customer claims and
settlements of contract liabilities of $310 million and write-offs principally
related to asset impairments, including receivables and inventories, of $335
million. In 2001, we adopted a plan to dispose of our Friction Materials
business and held discussions with a potential acquiror of the business. The
Friction Materials business was designated as held for disposal, and we
recognized an impairment charge of $145 million related to the write-down of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets
to their fair value less costs to sell. We recognized charges of $112 million
related to an other than temporary decline in the value of an equity investment
and an equity investee&#39;s loss contract and a $100 million charge for write-off
of investments, including inventory, related to a regional jet engine contract
cancellation. We also recognized $42 million of transaction expenses related to
the proposed merger with GE and redeemed our $200 million 5 3/4% dealer
remarketable securities due 2011, resulting in a loss of $6 million.

    In 2000, we identified certain business units and manufacturing facilities
as non-core to our business strategy. As a result of this assessment, we
implemented cost reduction initiatives and conducted discussions with potential
acquirors of these businesses and assets. As part of this process, we evaluated
the businesses and assets for possible impairment. As a result of our analysis,
we recognized impairment charges in 2000 of $245 and $165 million principally
related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets of our Friction Materials business and a chemical
manufacturing facility, respectively. We recognized other charges consisting of
probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities of $87 million, and
contract claims, merger-related period expenses, other contingencies, and
write-offs of tangible assets removed from service, including inventory,
totaling $140 million. In addition, we recognized a charge of $37 million for
costs principally related to an equity investee&#39;s customer claims.

    In 1999, we recognized other charges consisting of losses on aerospace
engine maintenance contracts and a contract cancellation penalty totaling $45
million, customer and employee claims of $69 million, contract settlements and
contingent liabilities of $18 million, and other write-offs principally related
to tangible and intangible assets removed from service, including inventory, of
$152 million. We also recognized a $36 million charge resulting from an other
than temporary decline in value of an equity investment due to a significant
deterioration in market conditions and a $4 million charge related to an equity
investee&#39;s severance action involving approximately 220 employees.

NOTE 6 -- GAIN ON SALE OF NON-STRATEGIC BUSINESSES

    In 2001 Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems (BCVS) was designated as held for
disposal, and in January 2002, we reached an agreement in principle with
Knorr-Bremse AG (Knorr) to transfer our global interests in BCVS to Knorr. The
transfer is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. At
December 31, 2001, the assets of BCVS of approximately $173 million were
classified in Other Current Assets. BCVS had sales and segment profit of
approximately $375 and $57 million, respectively, in 2001.

    In 2000, as a result of a government mandate in connection with the merger
of AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell, we sold the TCAS product line of the
former Honeywell. We received approximately $215 million in cash resulting in a
pretax gain of $112 million. The TCAS product line had annual sales of
approximately $100 million.

    In 1999, we sold our Laminate Systems business for approximately $425
million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of $106 million. The Laminate Systems
business had annual sales of about $400 million.

    In April 1999, we reached an agreement with Tyco International Ltd. (Tyco)
and AMP Incorporated (AMP), settling AMP&#39;s claim to the gain we would realize on
the disposition of our investment in AMP common stock. We made a payment to AMP
of $50 million, and the parties released all claims that they had against each
other relating to AMP. Subsequently, we converted our investment in AMP

    The amount of federal tax net operating losses available for carryback or
carryforward at December 31, 2001 was $625 million, including $507 million
generated in 2001. The current year&#39;s loss can be carried back two years or
carried forward twenty years. Also, included are $118 million of loss
carryforwards that were generated by certain subsidiaries prior to their
acquisition and have expiration

dates through 2019. The use of pre-acquisition operating losses is subject to
limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. We do not anticipate that
these limitations will affect utilization of the carryforwards prior to their
expiration. We also have foreign net operating losses of $807 million which are
available to reduce future income tax payments in several countries, subject to
varying expiration rules.

    We have U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $167 million at December 31, 2001,
including carryforwards of $124 million with various expiration dates, and tax
credits of $43 million which are not subject to expiration.

    The increase in the valuation allowance of $47 million in 2001 is primarily
due to an increase in foreign net operating losses attributable to a Specialty
Material&#39;s business that are not expected to be utilized.

    Deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.0 billion
of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies, which are considered
to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of
tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.

    Cash payments of income taxes during the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $79,
$442 and $625 million, respectively.

&lt;/Table&gt;

    As a result of the net loss for 2001, 4,269,601 of dilutive securities
issuable in connection with stock plans have been excluded from the diluted loss
per share calculation because their effect would reduce the loss per share. In
2000 and 1999, the diluted earnings per share calculation excludes the effect of
stock options when the options&#39; exercise prices exceed the average market price
of the common shares during the period. In 2000 and 1999, the number of stock
options not included in the computations was 14,563,673 and 868,631,
respectively. These stock options were outstanding at the end of each of the
respective years.

    We sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to a
third party. The sold receivables are over-collateralized and we retain an
interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization.
New receivables are sold under the agreement as previously sold receivables are
collected. Losses are recognized when our interest in the receivables are sold.
The retained interest in the receivables is shown at the amounts expected to be
collected by us, and such carrying value approximates the fair value of our
retained interest. We are compensated for our services in the collection and
administration of the receivables.

    We maintain $2 billion of bank revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks which are comprised of: (a) a $1 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement and
(b) a $1 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement. The credit agreements are maintained
for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial
paper. We had no balance outstanding under either agreement at December 31,
2001.

    Neither of the credit agreements restricts our ability to pay dividends and
neither contains financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary
conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the
credit agreements would prevent any further borrowings and would generally
require the repayments of any outstanding borrowings under such credit
agreements. Such events of default include (a) non-payment of credit agreement
debt and interest, (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit agreement
covenants, (c) default on other debt in certain circumstances, (d) bankruptcy
and (e) defaults upon obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment
to lend under the credit

agreements if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or
more of our voting stock or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were
directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a
majority of the Board of Directors (the Board).

    Loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no
later than December 2, 2004. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.065
percent per annum on the aggregate commitment for the Five-Year Credit
Agreement.

    Interest on borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement would be
determined, at our option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest
of the floating base rate of the agent bank, 0.5 percent above the average CD
rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or (c) the Eurocurrency rate
plus 0.135 percent (applicable margin).

    The commitments under the 364-Day Credit Agreement terminate on November 28,
2002. Annually, prior to the Agreement&#39;s anniversary date, we may request that
the termination date of the 364-Day Credit Agreement be extended by 364 days. We
have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.06 percent per annum on the aggregate
commitment for the 364-Day Credit Agreement, and we have paid upfront fees of
0.04 percent.

    Interest on borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement would be
determined, at our option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest
of the floating base rate of the agent bank, 0.5 percent above the average CD
rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or (c) the Eurocurrency rate
plus 0.24 percent (applicable margin).

    The facility fee and the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate on
both the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement are subject
to increase or decrease if our long-term debt ratings change, but the revolving
credit facilities are not subject to termination based on a decrease in our debt
ratings.

    We have entered into agreements to lease land, equipment and buildings.
Principally all our operating leases have initial terms of up to 25 years, and
some contain renewal options subject to customary conditions. At any time during
the terms of some of our leases, we may at our option purchase the leased assets
for amounts that approximate fair value. If we elect not to purchase the assets
at the end of each such lease, we have guaranteed the residual values of the
underlying assets (principally aircraft, equipment, buildings and land),
totaling approximately $349 million at December 31, 2001. We do not expect that
any of our commitments under the lease agreements will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

    Rent expense was $321, $306 and $291 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

NOTE 18 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial
position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate
and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing
activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial
instruments.

    CREDIT AND MARKET RISK -- Financial instruments, including derivatives,
expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk
related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our
exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards,
diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of
credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks
with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the
impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and
other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest
and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial
instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged
derivative financial instruments.

    We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we
grant credit terms in the normal course of business. While concentrations of
credit risk associated with our trade accounts and notes receivable are
considered minimal due to our diverse customer base, a significant portion of
our customers are in the commercial aviation industry (aircraft manufacturers
and airlines) accounting for approximately 19 percent of our consolidated sales
in 2001. Following the abrupt downturn in the aviation industry after the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the already weak economy, we
modified terms and conditions of our credit sales to mitigate or eliminate
concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not
materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT -- We conduct our business on a
multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to
market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from
international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising
from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of
cash flows in non-functional currencies. We attempt to have all transaction
exposures hedged with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once
these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and
option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to
the Euro countries, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the U.S. dollar.

    We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Prior to conversion into U.S dollars, these assets and liabilities are
remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The
effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in
Other (Income) Expense. We hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange
rates principally with forward contracts. Forward contracts are marked-to-market
with the resulting gains and losses similarly recognized in earnings offsetting
the gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
liabilities being hedged.

    We partially hedge forecasted 2002 sales and purchases denominated in
foreign currencies with currency forward contracts. When the dollar strengthens
against foreign currencies, the decline in value of forecasted foreign currency
cash inflows (sales) or outflows (purchases) is partially offset by the
recognition of gains (sales) and losses (purchases), respectively, in the value
of the forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, when the dollar
weakens against foreign currencies, the increase in value of forecasted foreign
currency cash inflows (sales) or outflows (purchases) is partially offset by the
recognition of losses (sales) and gains (purchases), respectively, in the value
of the forward

contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts
are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Deferred
gains and losses on forward contracts, used to hedge forecasted sales and
purchases, were $2 and $2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The
deferred gains and losses are expected to be reclassified into Sales and Cost of
Goods Sold within the next twelve months. All open forward contracts mature by
December 31, 2002.

    At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had contracts with notional amounts of
$1,507 and $1,542 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies,
principally in the Euro countries and Great Britain.

    COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT -- Our exposure to market risk for commodity
prices arises from changes in our cost of production. We mitigate our exposure
to commodity price risk through the use of long-term, firm-price contracts with
our suppliers and forward commodity purchase agreements with third parties
hedging anticipated purchases of several commodities (principally natural gas).
Forward commodity purchase agreements are marked-to-market, with the resulting
gains and losses recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is
recognized.

     INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT -- We use a combination of financial
instruments, including medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate
commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our
total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2001
and 2000, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
effectively changed $1,096 and $1,600 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt
at an average rate of 6.55 and 7.10 percent, respectively, to LIBOR based
floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature through 2007.

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper
and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
approximates fair value. Summarized below are the carrying values and fair
values of our other financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The
fair values are based on the quoted market prices for the issues (if traded),
current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturity and
characteristics, or other valuation techniques, as appropriate.

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, &#39;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,&#39; (SFAS No. 123) requires that the cost of stock-based
compensation be measured using a fair value based method. As permitted by SFAS
No. 123, we elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation using
the intrinsic value based method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, &#39;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.&#39; Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for our fixed stock option plans. The following table
sets forth pro forma information, including related assumptions, as if
compensation cost had been determined consistent with the requirements of SFAS

    RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS -- Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the
holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest.
RSU&#39;s are issued to certain key employees as compensation and as incentives tied
directly to the achievement of certain performance objectives.

    RSU&#39;s issued were 186,500, 1,374,640 and 1,175,127 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,

    NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS&#39; PLAN -- We also have a Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (Directors&#39; Plan) under which restricted shares and options are
granted. Each new director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 shares of common
stock, subject to specific restrictions. The Directors&#39; Plan provides for an
annual grant to each director of options to purchase 2,000 shares of common
stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. We have set aside 450,000
shares for issuance under the Directors&#39; Plan. Options generally become
exercisable over a three-year period and expire after ten years.

    EMPLOYEE STOCK MATCH PLANS -- We sponsor employee savings plans under which
we match, in the form of our common stock, certain eligible U.S. employee
savings plan contributions. Shares issued under the stock match plans were 4.9,
3.9 and 2.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, at a cost of $185,
$161 and $142 million, respectively.

NOTE 22 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    LITTON LITIGATION -- On March 13, 1990, Litton Systems, Inc. (Litton) filed
a legal action against the former Honeywell in U.S. District Court, Central
District of California, Los Angeles with claims that were subsequently split
into two separate cases. One alleged patent infringement under federal law for
using an ion-beam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the former Honeywell&#39;s
ring laser gyroscopes and tortious interference under state law for interfering
with Litton&#39;s prospective advantage with customers and contractual relationships
with an inventor and his company, Ojai Research, Inc. The other case alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal antitrust laws by the
former Honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems containing ring laser
gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market. On December 21, 2001, we settled
the Litton legal action for $440 million, reaching a settlement agreement with
Northrop Grumman (Northrop), which purchased Litton earlier in 2001. The
settlement amount was included as part of Costs of Goods Sold. In December 2001,
$220 million of the settlement amount was paid to Northrop with the remaining
$220 million due on or before July 1, 2002. The settlement ends the patent
infringement, antitrust and other claims that Litton originally brought against
the former Honeywell and allows us to continue to sell ring-laser-gyroscope-
based products and certain other inertial reference systems free from any claims
from Northrop.

    SHAREOWNER LITIGATION -- Honeywell and seven of its current and former
officers were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits
filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the
Securities Law Complaints). The Securities Law Complaints principally allege
that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly making false
and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information
concerning Honeywell&#39;s financial performance, thereby allegedly causing the
value of Honeywell&#39;s stock to be artificially inflated. The purported class
period for which damages are sought is December 20, 1999 to June 19, 2000. On
January 15, 2002, the District Court dismissed the consolidated complaint
against four of Honeywell&#39;s current and former officers.

    In addition, Honeywell, seven of its current and former officers and its
Board have been named as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action
which was filed on November 27, 2000 in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey (the Derivative Complaint). The Derivative Complaint
alleges a single claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical
allegations to those set forth in the Securities Law Complaints.

    We believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the Securities Law Complaints and the Derivative Complaint. Although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases, we expect to
prevail. However, an adverse outcome could be material to our consolidated
financial position or results of operations. As a result of the uncertainty
regarding the outcome of this matter, no provision has been made in our
financial statements with respect to this contingent liability.

    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -- We are subject to various federal, state and local
government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety
and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies,
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and personal injury to our employees and employees of our
customers and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations. However,
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we,
like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial
response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to
lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past
production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the
future.

    With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we
continually conduct studies, individually at our owned sites, and jointly as a
member of industry groups at non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. With respect to
environmental matters involving the production of products containing toxic
substances, we believe that the costs of defending and resolving such matters
will be largely covered by insurance, subject to deductibles, exclusions,
retentions and policy limits. It is our policy (see Note 1) to record
appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when environmental assessments
are made or remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. With respect to site contamination, the timing of
these accruals is generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies.
We expect that we will be able to fund expenditures for these matters from
operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of
factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of personal injury
and property damage claims, insurance recoveries, regulatory approval of cleanup
projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.

    Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations. However,
considering our past experience, insurance coverage and reserves, we do not
expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position.

    ASBESTOS MATTERS -- Like more than a thousand other industrial companies,
Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. Our
involvement is limited because we did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we
make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been
identified as the primary cause of asbestos-related disease in the vast majority
of claimants. Rather, we made several products that contained small amounts of
asbestos.

    Honeywell&#39;s Bendix Friction Materials business manufactured automotive brake
pads that included asbestos in an encapsulated form. There is a limited group of
potential claimants consisting largely of professional brake mechanics. During
the twenty-year period from 1981 through 2001, we have resolved approximately
53,000 Bendix claims at an average cost per claim of one thousand dollars.
Honeywell has had no out-of-pocket costs for these cases since its insurance
deductible was satisfied many years ago. There are currently approximately
47,000 claims pending and we have no reason to believe that the historic rate of
dismissal will change. We have $2 billion of insurance remaining.

    Another source of claims is refractory products (high temperature bricks and
cement) sold largely to the steel industry in the East and Midwest by North
American Refractories Company (NARCO), a business we owned from 1979 to 1986.
Less than 2 percent of NARCO&#39;s products contained asbestos.

    When we sold the NARCO business in 1986, we agreed to indemnify NARCO with
respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior
to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for
all other claims. NARCO has resolved approximately

                                       51





&lt;Page&gt;

                          HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

176,000 claims in the past 18 years at an average cost per claim of two thousand
two hundred dollars. Of those claims, 43 percent were dismissed on the ground
that there was insufficient evidence that NARCO was responsible for the
claimant&#39;s asbestos exposure. There are approximately 116,000 claims currently
pending against NARCO, including approximately 7 percent in which Honeywell is
also named as a defendant. During the past 18 years, Honeywell and our insurers
have contributed to the cost of the NARCO defense. We have in excess of $1.2
billion of insurance remaining that can be specifically allocated to
NARCO-related liability.

    On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, all of the claims pending against NARCO are
automatically stayed pending the reorganization of NARCO. In addition, because
the claims pending against Honeywell necessarily will impact the liabilities of
NARCO, because the insurance policies held by Honeywell are essential to a
successful NARCO reorganization, and because Honeywell has offered to commit
those policies to the reorganization, the bankruptcy court has temporarily
enjoined any claims against Honeywell, current or future, related to NARCO. In
connection with NARCO&#39;s bankruptcy filing, we paid NARCO&#39;s parent company $40
million and have agreed to provide NARCO with up to $20 million in financing. We
have also agreed to pay $20 million to NARCO&#39;s parent company upon the filing of
a plan of reorganization for NARCO acceptable to Honeywell, and to pay NARCO&#39;s
parent company $40 million, and to forgive any outstanding NARCO indebtedness,
upon the confirmation and consummation of such a plan.

    We believe that, as part of the NARCO plan of reorganization, a trust will
be established for the benefit of all asbestos claimants, current and future.
Honeywell intends to contribute its insurance coverage (which is in excess of
$1.2 billion) to the trust in exchange for its indemnity obligation to NARCO. If
that trust is put in place and approved by the court as fair and equitable,
Honeywell as well as NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction
barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and
requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be
made against the federally-supervised trust. In our view, our existing insurance
plus the existing NARCO assets should be sufficient to fund the trust. There is
no assurance that a stay will remain in effect, that a plan of reorganization
will be proposed or confirmed, or that any plan that is confirmed will provide
relief to Honeywell.

    Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims
or the NARCO bankruptcy, in light of the nature of the potential exposure, our
experience over the past 20 years in resolving asbestos-related claims, our
insurance coverage, our existing reserves and the NARCO bankruptcy proceeding,
we do not believe that asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

    OTHER MATTERS -- We are subject to a number of other lawsuits,
investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising
out of the conduct of our business. With respect to all these other matters,
including those relating to commercial transactions, government contracts,
product liability and non-environmental health and safety matters, while the
ultimate results of these lawsuits, investigations and claims cannot be
determined, we do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

    We have issued or are a party to various direct and indirect guarantees of
the debt of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties of $80 million. We do
not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

NOTE 23 -- PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

    We maintain pension plans covering the majority of our employees and
retirees, and postretirement benefit plans for retirees that include health care
benefits and life insurance coverage. Pension benefits for substantially all
U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, defined benefit pension
plans. Employees in foreign countries, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by

various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be
defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Our retiree medical plans
cover U.S. and Canadian employees who retire with pension eligibility for
hospital, professional and other medical services. Most of the U.S. retiree
medical plans require deductibles and copayments, and virtually all are
integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based
on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. The retiree medical and life
insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our general
assets.

    Net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (income) include
the following components:

    The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets for our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were $1,296, $1,262 and $865 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2001 and $350, $310 and $44 million, respectively, at December 31,
2000.

    For measurement purposes, we assumed an annual health-care cost trend rate
of 8.25 percent for covered healthcare benefits in 2002. The rate was assumed to
decrease gradually to 5 percent in 2007 and remain at that level thereafter.
Assumed health-care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for our retiree health-care plan. A one-percentage-point change in
assumed health-care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

NOTE 24 -- SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, &#39;Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#39; (SFAS No. 131), establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments. The following
information is provided in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 131 and
is consistent with how business results are reported internally to management.

    We globally manage our business operations through strategic business units
(SBUs) serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control
technologies for buildings, homes and industry, automotive products and
chemicals. Based on similar economic and operational characteristics, our SBUs
are aggregated into the following four reportable segments:

     Aerospace includes Engines, Systems and Services (auxiliary power units;
     propulsion engines; environmental control systems; engine controls; repair
     and overhaul services; hardware; logistics and power generation systems);
     Aerospace Electronic Systems (flight safety communications, navigation,
     radar and surveillance systems; aircraft and airfield lighting; management
     and technical services and advanced systems and instruments); and Aircraft
     Landing Systems (aircraft wheels and brakes).

     Automation and Control Solutions includes Control Products (controls for
     heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home
     automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and
     optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for
     measuring pressure, air flow, temperature, electrical current and more);
     Service (installs, maintains and upgrades systems that keep buildings safe,
     comfortable and productive); Security &amp; Fire Solutions (manufactures and
     distributes security and fire detection, access control and video
     surveillance systems); and Industry Solutions (provides full range of

     automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in
     many types of industrial settings).

     Specialty Materials includes fibers; plastic resins; specialty films;
     intermediate chemicals; fluorine-based products; pharmaceutical and
     agricultural chemicals; specialty waxes, adhesives and sealants; process
     technology; wafer fabrication materials and services; advanced circuits;
     and amorphous metals.

     Transportation and Power Systems includes Garrett Engine Boosting Systems
     (turbochargers and charge-air coolers); Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems
     (air brake and anti-lock braking systems); the Consumer Products Group (car
     care products including anti-freeze, filters, spark plugs, cleaners, waxes
     and additives); and Friction Materials (friction material and related brake
     system components).

    The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1. We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, which excludes
general corporate unallocated expenses, gains on sales of non-strategic
businesses, equity income, other (income) expense, interest and other financial
charges and merger, repositioning and other charges. Intersegment sales
approximate market and are not significant. Reportable segment data were as

Senior Vice President Administration and Chief Information Officer, was reported
after the filing deadline.

(1) Options are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which assumes
    a historic five-year average volatility of 40.8 percent, the average
    dividend yield for the three years ended December 31, 2001 (1.5 percent), a
    5.2 percent risk-free rate of return (based on the five-year U.S. Treasury
    note yield on the date of grant), and an expected option life of 5.0 years
    based on past experience. No adjustments are made for non-transferability or
    risk of forfeiture. Options will have no actual value unless, and then only
    to the extent that, the common stock price appreciates from the grant date
    to the exercise date. If the grant date present values are realized, total
    shareowner value will have appreciated by approximately $11.3 billion, and
    the value of the granted options reflected in the table will be less than
    0.15 percent of the total shareowner appreciation.

(2) Vests 100 percent on July 1, 2002.

(3) Vests 40 percent on January 1, 2002 and 30 percent on each of January 1,
    2003 and 2004.

(1) The table reflects options exercised prior to Mr. Bossidy&#39;s return to
    Honeywell on July 3, 2001.

(2) Upon his retirement, Mr. Bonsignore forfeited 500,000 unexercisable options.

EMPLOYMENT AND TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS

    Mr. Bossidy&#39;s employment agreement provides for his employment as Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer through June 30, 2002. During the term of the
agreement, Mr. Bossidy will have an annual salary of at least $2,000,000 and
will have an annual target bonus equal to 100 percent of base salary. If his
employment is terminated prior to the expiration of his agreement, Honeywell
will continue to provide Mr. Bossidy with compensation, benefits, and other
compensation arrangements for the balance of the outstanding term.

    Mr. Bonsignore&#39;s employment agreement provided for his employment as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2004. During the term
of the agreement, Mr. Bonsignore was entitled to receive an annual salary of at
least $1,500,000 and an annual target bonus equal to 100 percent of base salary.
Under the terms of his agreement, he was entitled to a severance payment of
three times his annual salary and bonus upon his retirement in July 2001.

                                       64





&lt;Page&gt;

    Under the Severance Plan for Senior Executives, the current executive
officers named in the Summary Compensation Table would be entitled to payments
equivalent to base salary and annual incentive bonus (and continuation of
certain benefits, such as group life and medical insurance coverage) for a
period of 36 months if their employment is terminated other than for &#39;gross
cause&#39; (which includes fraud and criminal conduct). The payments would be made
in a lump sum following a change in control. The Severance Plan for Senior
Executives provides for an additional payment sufficient to eliminate the effect
of any applicable excise tax on severance payments in excess of an amount
determined under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Payments subject to
the excise tax would not be deductible by Honeywell.

    On February 19, 2002, Mr. David M. Cote entered into an employment agreement
with Honeywell that provides for his employment as President and Chief Executive
Officer through June 30, 2002 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer effective
July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007. During the term of the agreement Mr. Cote
will have an annual salary of at least $1,500,000 and an annual target bonus
equal to 125 percent of his base salary. He was granted 2,202,200 stock options
and 770,000 restricted units on his start date. He may also receive a cash
payment equal to any amount due him under the bonus plan of his prior employer
not paid by that employer. If his employment is terminated prior to the
expiration of his agreement, Honeywell will continue to provide Mr. Cote with
compensation, benefits, and other compensation arrangements for the balance of
the outstanding term.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

    The following table illustrates the estimated annual pension benefits which
would be provided on retirement at age 65 under Honeywell&#39;s retirement program
and an unfunded supplemental retirement plan, after applicable deductions for
Social Security benefits, to salaried employees having specified average
annual remuneration and years of service.

&lt;/Table&gt;

    The benefit amounts shown in the Pension Table are computed on a straight
life annuity basis. At January 1, 2002, the following individuals had the
indicated number of years of credited service for pension purposes:
Mr. Bossidy, 9; Mr. Bonsignore, 31; Mr. R. Johnson, 7; Mr. Kreindler, 10;
Mr. Wallman, 6; and Dr. B. Johnson, 2.

    The amounts in the Salary and Bonus columns of the Summary Compensation
Table for 2001 would be included in computing remuneration for pension purposes
as well as any payroll based reward and recognition awards. Average annual
remuneration under the retirement program is calculated based on the highest
paid 60 consecutive months of an employee&#39;s last 120 months of employment.

    Under their employment agreements, Messrs. Bossidy, Cote and Bonsignore are
entitled to receive during their lifetimes, commencing on retirement, Honeywell
facilities and services comparable to those provided prior to their retirement,
and a retirement benefit equivalent to 60 percent of final average compensation
(based on their highest three years of salary and bonus) payable annually for
life. Benefits under the agreements will be reduced by any retirement benefits
payable under Honeywell&#39;s retirement and supplemental retirement plans, and
under certain circumstances, benefits payable under retirement plans of former
employers. Mr. Bonsignore&#39;s early retirement agreement increases his retirement
benefit to 70 percent of final average compensation.

    Dr. B. Johnson is covered by a pension arrangement that provides an age 60
retirement benefit of $36,139, payable annually for life, to complement the
benefit from his former employer.

&lt;Page&gt;

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

    Directors who are employees of Honeywell receive no compensation for service
on the Board. Each non-employee director receives an annual Board retainer of
$65,000, of which $20,000 is automatically credited to the director&#39;s account in
the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors in the form of common
stock equivalents (which are only payable after termination of Board service).
They also receive a fee of $2,000 for Board meetings attended on any day (eleven
during 2001), an annual retainer of $7,000 for each Board Committee served, and
an additional Committee Chair retainer of $5,000 for the Audit and Management
Development and Compensation Committees and $3,000 for all other Board
Committees. While no fees are generally paid for attending Committee meetings, a
$1,000 fee is paid for attendance at a Committee meeting, or other extraordinary
meeting related to Board business which occurs apart from a Board meeting.
Non-employee directors are also provided with $350,000 in business travel
accident insurance and are eligible to elect $100,000 in term life insurance and
medical and dental coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents.

    Directors may elect to defer, until a specified calendar year or retirement
from the Board, all or any portion of their annual retainers and fees that are
not automatically deferred and to have such compensation credited to their
account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts credited either accrue
interest (11 percent for 2001) or are valued as if invested in common stock
equivalents or one of the other funds available to participants in our savings
plan. Amounts deferred in a common stock account earn amounts equivalent to
dividends. Upon a change of control, a director will be entitled to a lump-sum
payment of all deferred amounts.

    Under the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, each new director receives
a one-time grant of 3,000 shares of common stock, which are subject to transfer
restrictions until the director&#39;s service terminates with the consent of a
majority of the Board, provided termination occurs at or after age 65. During
the restricted period, the director is entitled to one-fifth of the shares
granted for each year of service (up to five). However, the shares will be
forfeited if the director&#39;s service terminates (other than for death or
disability) prior to the end of the restricted period. The Plan also provides
for an annual grant to each director of options to purchase 2,000 shares of
common stock at 100 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant.
Option grants vest in cumulative installments of 40 percent on April 1 of the
year following the grant date and an additional 30 percent on April 1 of each of
the next two years.

MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

    The primary functions of the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of the Board are to review and recommend the compensation arrangements
for officers; approve compensation arrangements for other senior level
employees; consider matters related to management development and succession and
recommend individuals for election as officers; and review or take such other
action as may be required in connection with the bonus, stock and other benefit
plans of Honeywell and its subsidiaries. The members of the Committee are:
Robert P. Luciano (Chair), Hans W. Becherer, Gordon M. Bethune, Bruce Karatz,
Ivan G. Seidenberg and John R. Stafford.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

STOCK OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    At December 31, 2001, State Street Bank and Trust Company, 225 Franklin
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02101 held 72,047,278 shares or approximately 8.8
percent of our outstanding common stock as trustee of certain of Honeywell&#39;s
savings plans. Under the terms of the plans, State Street is required to vote
shares attributable to any participant in accordance with instructions received
from the participant and to vote all shares for which it does not receive
instructions in the same ratio as the shares for which instructions were
received. State Street disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares referred to
above. State Street also held 19,171,688 shares, or approximately 2.4 percent of
our outstanding common stock in various other fiduciary capacities.

    At December 31, 2001, Capital Research and Management Company, 333 South
Hope Street, Los Angeles, California, 90071 owned 47,698,600 shares of common
stock representing approximately 5.9 percent of our outstanding common stock.

STOCK OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

    In general, &#39;beneficial ownership&#39; includes those shares a director or
executive officer has the power to vote or transfer, and stock options that are
exercisable currently or within 60 days. On December 31, 2001, the directors and
executive officers of Honeywell beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 6,678,131
shares of common stock which are included in the table below. Directors and
executive officers also have interests in stock-based units under Honeywell&#39;s

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

    In connection with certain tax planning for Honeywell, we secured
supplemental retirement payments for three executives by funding them through an
escrow arrangement. By securing the payments, the executive&#39;s tax liability was
accelerated. We loaned each executive an amount equal to the related withholding
tax obligation at the time the payments were secured. The loans bear interest at
5.53 percent compounded semiannually and are due December 31, 2004. At
December 31, 2001, the amount of loans outstanding totaled $3,089,590, of which
$1,635,200 was loaned to Mr. Bonsignore, $765,450 to Mr. Wallman and $688,940 to
Dr. B. Johnson. Mr. Bonsignore&#39;s loan has been repaid.

         ratings, the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Utilization Fee and the
         Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the level
         that is one level above such lower rating; (d) if any rating
         established by S&amp;P or Moody&#39;s shall be changed, such change shall be

         reference to the Public Debt Rating announced by S&amp;P or Moody&#39;s, as the

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

    On October 22, 2000, Honeywell entered into a merger agreement with General
Electric Company (GE). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of
Honeywell common stock will be exchangeable for 1.055 shares of GE common stock
at the effective time of the merger, with fractional shares paid in cash, and
Honeywell will become a wholly owned subsidiary of GE. The transaction was
approved by Honeywell&#39;s shareowners on January 10, 2001, and it remains subject
to regulatory reviews. GE and Honeywell are working with regulatory agencies to
complete the required reviews so that the transaction can close as early as
possible in 2001.

AEROSPACE SALES

    Our sales to aerospace customers were 40, 42 and 42 percent of our total
sales in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Our sales to aerospace original
equipment manufacturers were 14, 15 and 16 percent of our total sales in 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. If there were a large decline in sales of aircraft
that use our components, operating results could be negatively impacted. In
addition, our sales to aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services
were 19, 19 and 18 percent of our total sales in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. If there were a large decline in the number of flight hours for
aircraft that use our components or services, operating results could be
negatively impacted.

U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES

    Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by our Aerospace Solutions
segment), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime
contractors, amounted to $2,219, $2,383 and $2,693 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively, which includes sales to the U.S. Department of Defense of
$1,548, $1,415 and $1,658 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. We are
affected by U.S. Government budget constraints for defense and space programs.
U.S. defense spending increased slightly in 2000 and is also expected to
increase slightly in 2001.

    In addition to normal business risks, companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual
risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies that may reflect military and political
developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design
improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating
increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of
forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly
sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the industry.
Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly
development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices.

    We, like other government contractors, are subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations. Although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or barred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty, we are not

                                       7





&lt;PAGE&gt;
currently aware of any such investigations that we expect, individually or in
the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we have a
proactive business compliance program designed to ensure compliance and sound
business practices.

BACKLOG

    Our total backlog at year-end 2000 and 1999 was $8,094 and $8,736 million,
respectively. We anticipate that approximately $5,090 million of the 2000
backlog will be filled in 2001. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer&#39;s option.

COMPETITION

    We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and
service areas. Such competition is expected to continue in all geographic
regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and
services provided by us, and vary country by country. Depending on the
particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of
factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service,
performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition.
Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important
competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable
price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include
breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and
managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products
and services, we believe we are a significant factor in each of our major
product and service classes. However, certain of our products and services are
sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of
which have substantial financial resources and significant technological
capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive
component divisions of original equipment manufacturers.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

    We are engaged in manufacturing, sales and/or research and development
mainly in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and
foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations.

    Our international operations, including U.S. exports, are potentially
subject to a number of unique risks and limitations, including: fluctuations in
currency value; exchange control regulations; wage and price controls;
employment regulations; foreign investment laws; import and trade restrictions,
including embargoes; and governmental instability. However, we have limited
exposure in high risk countries and have taken action to mitigate such risks.

    Financial information related to geographic areas is included in &#39;Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 25 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

RAW MATERIALS

    The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily
available. We experienced no significant or unusual problems in the purchase of
key raw materials and commodities in 2000. We are not dependent on any one
supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. However, we are highly
dependent on our suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
our customers. In addition, many major components and product equipment items
are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic
and foreign companies. We maintain a qualification and performance surveillance
process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. While we
believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally
adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future. However, at present, we have no reason to believe a
shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impact during 2001.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

    Our business as a whole, and that of our strategic business units, are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or
distribution rights. We own, or are licensed under, a large number of patents,
patent applications and trademarks acquired over a period of many

                                       8





&lt;PAGE&gt;
years, which relate to many of our products or improvements thereon and are of
importance to our business. From time to time, new patents and trademarks are
obtained, and patent and trademark licenses and rights are acquired from others.
We also have distribution rights of varying terms for a number of products and
services produced by other companies. In the judgment of management, such rights
are adequate for the conduct of the business being done by us. We believe that,
in the aggregate, the rights under such patents, trademarks and licenses are
generally important to our operations, but we do not consider that any patent,
trademark or related group of patents, or any licensing or distribution rights
related to a specific process or product are of material importance in relation
to our total business. See Item 3 at page 10 of this Form 10-K for information
concerning litigation relating to patents in which we are involved.

    We have registered trademarks for a number of our products, including such
consumer brands as Honeywell, Prestone, FRAM, Anso and Autolite.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Our research activities are directed toward the discovery and development of
new products and processes, improvements in existing products and processes, and
the development of new uses of existing products.

    Research and development expense totaled $818, $909 and $876 million in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S.
Government) research and development activities amounted to an additional $560,
$682 and $718 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

    We are subject to various federal, state and local requirements regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment. It is our policy to comply with these
requirements and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices
and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with
our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in certain
of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar
businesses.

    We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use or disposal
of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory
agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our handling, manufacture, use
and disposal of such substances are in accord with environmental laws and
regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other
developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and
enforcement policies thereunder, could bring into question our handling,
manufacture, use or disposal of such substances.

    Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal
superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we have been designated as a
potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated
with various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency&#39;s superfund priority list. Although, under some court
interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party
might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it
is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we
have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-
party situations taken as a whole.

    Further information regarding environmental matters is included in &#39;Item 7.

Operations.&#39;

EMPLOYEES

    We have approximately 125,000 employees at December 31, 2000. Approximately
86,000 were located in the United States, and, of these employees, about 17%
were unionized employees represented by various local or national unions.

&lt;PAGE&gt;
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    We have over 1,000 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories,
sales offices and other facilities. The plants are generally located to serve
large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor
pools. The properties are generally maintained in good operating condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other
business conditions; however, no major operating facility is significantly
idle. The facilities, together with planned expansions, are expected to meet
our needs for the foreseeable future. We own or lease warehouses, railroad
cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and data
processing equipment. We also lease space for administrative and sales staffs.
Our headquarters and administrative complex is located at Morristown, New
Jersey.

    Our principal plants, which are owned in fee unless otherwise indicated, are
as follows:

    Net sales in 2000 were $25,023 million, an increase of $1,288 million, or
5 percent compared with 1999. Net sales in 1999 were $23,735 million, an
increase of $180 million, or 1 percent compared with 1998. The increase in sales
in both 2000 and 1999 is attributable to the following:

    Total segment profit in 2000 was $3,629 million, an increase of $358
million, or 11 percent compared with 1999. Segment profit margin for 2000 was
14.5 percent compared with 13.8 percent in 1999. The increase in segment profit
in 2000 was led by a significant improvement by the Aerospace Solutions and
Automation &amp; Control segments and lower Corporate expenses. The increase was
partially offset by lower segment profit by the Performance Materials and Power
&amp; Transportation Products segments. Total segment profit in 1999 was
$3,271 million, an increase of $359 million, or 12 percent compared with 1998.
Segment profit margin for 1999 was 13.8 percent compared with 12.4 percent in
1998. The increase in segment profit in 1999 was led by a substantial
improvement by the Aerospace Solutions segment with the Power &amp; Transportation
Products and Automation &amp; Control segments also contributing solid gains. Lower
Corporate expenses also contributed to the increase. The increase was partially
offset by a substantial decrease in segment profit by the Performance Materials
segment.

    Postretirement benefit plans contributed cost reductions of $282 and $61
million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, principally due to workforce reductions
and the funding status of our pension plans (described in &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements).
Future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment
performance.

                                       12





&lt;PAGE&gt;
    A discussion of net sales and segment profit by reportable segment can be
found in the Review of Business Segments section below.

    (Gain) on sale of non-strategic businesses of $112 million in 2000
represents the pretax gain on the government-mandated divestiture of the TCAS
product line of Honeywell Inc. (the former Honeywell) following the merger of
AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell Inc. in December 1999. (Gain) on sale of
non-strategic businesses of $106 million in 1999 represents the pretax gain on
the sale of our Laminate Systems business. Refer to &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements
for further information.

    Equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies was a loss of $89 million in
2000 compared with income of $76 million in 1999. The decrease of $165 million
in equity income reflects that the current year includes a charge of
$136 million for costs associated with closing an affiliate&#39;s chemical
manufacturing operations and for an equity investee&#39;s customer claims. The prior
year also included a charge of $40 million related to the writedown of an equity
investment and an equity investee&#39;s severance actions. Refer to &#39;Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 5 of Notes to Financial
Statements for further discussion of the charges in both 2000 and 1999.
Excluding these charges in both periods, equity in (income) loss of affiliated
companies was income of $47 million in 2000, a decrease of $69 million compared
with 1999. This decrease was due mainly to lower earnings from our UOP process
technology (UOP) joint venture partially offset by the gain on the sale of our
interest in an automotive aftermarket joint venture. Equity in (income) loss of
affiliated companies was income of $76 million in 1999 compared with income of
$162 million in 1998. The decrease of $86 million resulted from the charge of
$40 million relating to the writedown of an equity investment and an equity
investee&#39;s severance actions as well as lower earnings from UOP.

    Other (income) expense, $57 million of income in 2000, decreased by
$250 million compared with 1999. The decrease principally reflects the 1999 net
gain of $268 million on our disposition of our investment in AMP Incorporated
(AMP) common stock. Refer to &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data&#39; in Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information.
Excluding this net gain, other (income) expense was $57 million of income in
2000, compared with $39 million of income in 1999. This increase in other income
of $18 million in 2000 was due principally to lower minority interest expense
and increased benefits from foreign exchange hedging. Other (income) expense,
$307 million of income in 1999, increased by $280 million compared with 1998.
The increase principally reflects the net gain of $268 million on our
disposition of our investment in AMP common stock.

    Interest and other financial charges of $481 million in 2000 increased by
$216 million, or 82 percent compared with 1999. The increase results from higher
average levels of debt during the current year due principally to the Pittway
acquisition and our share repurchase program, higher average interest rates and
the impact of tax interest expense. Interest and other financial charges of
$265 million in 1999 decreased by $10 million, or 4 percent compared with 1998.
The decrease resulted from lower interest rates and tax interest expense
somewhat offset by the effects of higher average debt outstanding during 1999.

    The effective tax rate was 30.8, 31.5 and 31.3 percent in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Refer to &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements for further
information.

    Net income in 2000 of $1,659 million, or $2.05 per share, was 8 percent
higher than 1999 net income of $1,541 million, or $1.90 per share. Net income in
2000 included the gain on the disposition of the TCAS product line of the former
Honeywell and asset impairments, repositioning, environmental and other charges.
Adjusted for these items, net income in 2000 was $634 million, or $0.78 per
share, higher than reported. Net income in 1999 included the gains on our
dispositions of our Laminate Systems business and our investment in AMP and
merger, repositioning and other charges. Adjusted for these items, net income in
1999 was $624 million, or $0.78 per share, higher than reported. Net income in
2000 increased by 6 percent compared with 1999 if both years are adjusted for
these items. Net income in 1999 of $1,541 million, or $1.90 per share, was
19 percent lower than 1998 net income of $1,903 million, or $2.34 per share. Net
income in 1998 included repositioning charges, litigation

                                       13





&lt;PAGE&gt;
settlements and a tax settlement. Net income in 1999 increased by 14 percent
compared with 1998 if both years are adjusted for these items.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

    Aerospace Solutions sales in 2000 were $9,988 million, an increase of $80
million, or 1 percent compared with 1999. Higher sales to the aftermarket,
particularly repair and overhaul and the military, and increased original
equipment sales to business, regional and general aviation customers were
partially offset by lower original equipment sales to air transport
manufacturers and a decline in engineering services revenues. Sales also
decreased due to the effects of government-mandated divestitures in connection
with the merger of AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell. Aerospace Solutions
sales in 1999 were $9,908 million or basically flat compared with 1998. Sales of
avionics products were higher due principally to continued strong demand for
flight safety products. Sales to the aftermarket, particularly repair and
overhaul and the military, were also higher. The acquisition in 1998 of a
controlling interest in the Normalair-Garrett Ltd. environmental controls joint
venture also increased sales. This increase was offset by lower sales to air
transport and military original equipment manufacturers, and the effects of
divestitures and a restructuring of a government technical services contract.

    Aerospace Solutions segment profit in 2000 was $2,195 million, an increase
of $277 million, or 14 percent compared with 1999 due principally to cost
structure improvements, primarily from workforce and benefit cost reductions,
and merger-related savings. Increased sales of higher-margin aftermarket
products and services also contributed to the improvement in segment profit.
Aerospace Solutions segment profit in 1999 was $1,918 million, an increase of
$331 million, or 21 percent compared with 1998 due principally to increased
sales of higher-margin aftermarket and avionics products and cost structure
improvements primarily from workforce and benefit cost reductions.

    Automation &amp; Control sales in 2000 were $7,384 million, an increase of
$1,269 million, or 21 percent compared with 1999. Sales for our Home and
Building Control business were substantially higher as increased sales in our
security products business, due to the acquisition of Pittway, were partially
offset by lower sales in our solutions and services business. Sales for our
Industrial Control business declined moderately as growth in our sensing and
control business was more than offset by lower sales in our industrial
automation and control business. Our industrial automation and control business
continues to be adversely affected by weakness in the hydrocarbon processing
industry. Sales for the segment were also adversely impacted by foreign currency
fluctuations due to the strong dollar. Automation &amp; Control sales in 1999 were
$6,115 million, an increase of $158 million, or 3 percent compared with 1998.
Sales increased for our Home and Building Control business driven by growth in
our control products and building services, and security businesses.
Acquisitions also contributed to the increase partially offset by lower sales
from our energy retrofit and installed systems businesses. Sales for our
Industrial Control business were basically flat compared with 1998. Higher sales
due to acquisitions and growth in our sensing and control business were offset
by the effects of continued weakness in our industrial automation and control
business.

    Automation &amp; Control segment profit in 2000 was $986 million, an increase of
$219 million, or 29 percent compared with 1999. Segment profit for both our Home
and Building Control and Industrial Control businesses improved primarily as a
result of lower costs due to workforce and benefit cost reductions and
merger-related savings. The acquisition of Pittway and other portfolio changes
also contributed to the improvement in segment profit. Automation &amp; Control
segment profit in 1999 was $767 million, an increase of $62 million, or 9
percent compared with 1998. Segment profit for our Home and Building Control
business increased significantly due to improvement in our control products
business and the contraction of our lower-margin energy retrofit and installed
systems businesses. Cost savings from workforce reductions also contributed to
the improvement. This increase was offset somewhat by lower segment profit for
our Industrial Control business as growth in our higher-margin sensing and
control business and cost structure improvements were more than offset by the
effects of continued weakness in certain key end markets in our industrial
automation and control business.

    Performance Materials sales in 2000 were $4,055 million, an increase of $48
million, or 1 percent compared with 1999. Higher sales of advanced circuitry and
wafer-fabrication products by our

                                       14





&lt;PAGE&gt;
Electronic Materials business were largely offset by the effect of divestitures,
principally our Laminate Systems business. Performance Materials sales in 1999
were $4,007 million, a decrease of $162 million, or 4 percent compared with 1998
due principally to divestitures including our environmental catalyst, Laminate
Systems and phenol businesses. Lower sales for our carpet fibers business also
contributed to the decrease. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales
for our specialty films, engineering plastics and waxes businesses and increased
sales from the acquisitions of Johnson Matthey Electronics and Pharmaceutical
Fine Chemicals.

    Performance Materials segment profit in 2000 was $334 million, a decrease of
$105 million, or 24 percent compared with 1999. The decrease principally
reflects higher raw material costs in certain Performance Polymers and Chemicals
businesses and higher operating losses in our chip packaging and pharmaceutical
chemicals businesses. The decrease was partially offset by cost structure
improvements and price increases in certain Performance Polymers and Chemicals
businesses. Performance Materials segment profit in 1999 was $439 million, a
decrease of $195 million, or 31 percent compared with 1998. The decrease
principally reflects the effects of pricing pressures in our Performance
Polymers and Electronic Materials businesses and higher raw material costs in
certain Performance Polymers businesses. The impact of 1998 divestitures also
contributed to the decrease. The effect of improved sales volume for our
specialty films, engineering plastics and waxes businesses was a partial offset.

    Power &amp; Transportation Products sales in 2000 were $3,527 million, a
decrease of $54 million, or 2 percent compared with 1999 due mainly to lower
sales for our Commercial Vehicle Systems and Friction Materials businesses.
Sales for our Commercial Vehicles Systems business were negatively impacted by
decreased heavy-duty truck builds. Sales for our Friction Materials business
were lower mainly due to foreign currency fluctuations. This decrease was
partially offset by higher sales for our Turbocharging Systems business as
continued strong world-wide demand more than offset the adverse impact of
foreign currency fluctuations. Power &amp; Transportation Products sales in 1999
were $3,581 million, an increase of $194 million, or 6 percent compared with
1998. Sales for our Turbocharging Systems business increased significantly due
primarily to continued strong sales in Europe reflecting the turbodiesel&#39;s
increased penetration of the passenger car market. Sales for our Commercial
Vehicle Systems business also increased due principally to increased North
American truck builds. Sales for our Consumer Products Group business also
increased, led by higher sales of Prestone&#39;r&#39; products and FRAM&#39;r&#39; filters.
Lower sales for our Friction Materials business due to pricing pressures,
weakness in the European market and foreign currency fluctuations were a partial
offset.

    Power &amp; Transportation Products segment profit in 2000 was $274 million, a
decrease of $48 million, or 15 percent compared with 1999. The decrease
primarily reflects costs associated with a product recall and lower sales in our
Commercial Vehicle Systems business, costs related to the ramp-up of our
Turbogenerator product line and costs associated with a supplier issue in our
Turbocharging Systems business. The decrease was partially offset by the effects
of cost structure improvements in our Friction Materials and Consumer Products
Group businesses and higher sales in our Turbocharging Systems business. Power &amp;
Transportation Products segment profit in 1999 was $322 million, an increase of
$88 million, or 38 percent compared with 1998. The increase reflects higher
sales for our Turbocharging Systems, Commercial Vehicle Systems and Consumer
Products Group businesses. Cost structure improvements in these businesses,
materials procurement savings and workforce reductions also contributed to the
increase.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Total assets at December 31, 2000 were $25,175 million, an increase of
$1,648 million, or 7 percent from December 31, 1999. The increase relates
principally to our acquisition of Pittway. Total assets at December 31, 1999
were $23,527 million, an increase of $789 million, or 3 percent from
December 31, 1998.

    Cash provided by operating activities of $1,989 million during 2000
decreased by $385 million compared with 1999 due principally to spending related
to merger and repositioning actions, a decrease in working capital and higher
non-cash pension income. This decrease was partially offset by higher net
income, excluding one-time items as previously described, and lower taxes paid
on sales of

                                       15





&lt;PAGE&gt;
businesses and investments. Cash provided by operating activities of
$2,374 million during 1999 increased by $400 million compared with 1998 due
principally to higher net income, excluding one-time items as previously
described.

    Cash used for investing activities of $2,714 million during 2000 increased
by $2,423 million compared with 1999. The acquisition of Pittway, the fact that
the prior year included the net proceeds from our disposition of our investment
in AMP and lower proceeds from sales of businesses were principally responsible
for the increase. This increase was partially offset by lower capital spending.
Cash used for investing activities of $291 million during 1999 decreased by
$1,302 million compared with 1998. The decrease relates principally to the
proceeds from our disposition of our investment in AMP and an increase in
proceeds from sales of businesses, primarily Laminate Systems. This decrease was
partially offset by higher spending for acquisitions, mainly Johnson Matthey
Electronics, and the liquidation in 1998 of short-term investments.

    We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our
portfolio as to strategic fit, market position and profit contribution in order
to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify operating units that will most
benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will
further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also
identify operating units that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based
on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These
operating units are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other
repositioning action subject to regulatory constraints.

    Capital expenditures were $853, $986 and $1,037 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Spending by the reportable segments and Corporate since 1998
is shown in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 24 of
Notes to Financial Statements. Our total capital expenditures in 2001 are
currently projected at approximately $1 billion. These expenditures are expected
to be financed principally by internally generated funds and are primarily
planned for expansion and cost reduction.

    Cash used for financing activities of $70 million during 2000 decreased by
$1,040 million compared with 1999 led principally by a decrease in stock
repurchases and higher net issuances of debt. During 2000, we repurchased 4.3
million shares of our common stock for $166 million in connection with our share
repurchase program. As a result of the pending merger with General Electric (see
Item 8. &#39;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 4 of Notes to
Financial Statements), Honeywell rescinded its share repurchase program
effective October 21, 2000. Total debt of $5,623 million at December 31, 2000
was $557 million, or 11 percent higher than at December 31, 1999 due to the
acquisition of Pittway. Cash used for financing activities of $1,110 million
during 1999 increased by $1,002 million compared with 1998. The increase relates
principally to lower net issuances of debt partially offset by lower net stock
repurchases. Total debt of $5,066 million at year-end 1999 was $100 million, or
2 percent higher than at December 31, 1998.

    We maintain a $2 billion bank revolving credit facility which is comprised
of (a) a $1 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement; and, (b) a $1 billion 364-Day
Credit Agreement. The credit agreements were established for general corporate
purposes including support for the issuance of commercial paper. There was
$1,192 and $2,023 million of commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2000 and
1999, respectively. See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in
Note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements for details of long-term debt and a
discussion of the Credit Agreements.

    We believe that our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to
the public debt markets using debt securities and commercial paper, provide
adequate short-term and long-term liquidity.

MERGER AND REPOSITIONING CHARGES

    In 2000, we recognized a charge of $239 million related to announced global
workforce reductions in each of our reportable segments, costs to close a chip
package manufacturing plant and related workforce reductions in our Electronic
Materials business, and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shut-downs in our Performance Polymers
and Chemicals business. The components of the charge included severance costs of
$151 million and asset impairments of $88 million. The workforce reductions
consisted of approximately 2,800 manufacturing and administrative positions and
are expected to be substantially completed by

                                       16





&lt;PAGE&gt;
the end of the second quarter of 2001. Asset impairments were principally
related to manufacturing plant and equipment held for sale and capable of being
taken out of service and actively marketed in the period of impairment. Also,
$46 million of accruals established in 1999, principally for severance, were
returned to income in 2000 due to higher than expected voluntary employee
attrition (approximately 650 positions) resulting in reduced severance
liabilities principally in our Automation &amp; Control and Aerospace Solutions
reportable segments. We also recognized a charge of $99 million in equity in
(income) loss of affiliated companies for costs to close an affiliate&#39;s chemical
manufacturing operations. The components of the charge included severance costs
of $6 million, asset impairments of $53 million, and other environmental exit
costs and period expenses of $40 million.

    In 1999, upon completion of the merger between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell, we recognized a charge of $642 million for the cost of actions
designed to improve our combined competitiveness, productivity and future
profitability. The merger-related actions included the elimination of redundant
corporate offices and functional administrative overhead; elimination of
redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses; adoption of six sigma productivity initiatives at the former
Honeywell businesses; and, the transition to a global shared services model. The
components of the charge included severance costs of $342 million, asset
impairments of $108 million, other exit costs of $57 million and merger-related
transaction and period expenses of $135 million. Planned global workforce
reductions consisted of approximately 6,500 administrative and manufacturing
positions and are substantially complete. Asset impairments were principally
related to the elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace
facilities and equipment. Other exit costs were related to lease terminations
and contract cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation
at year-end. Merger-related transaction and period expenses consisted of
investment banking and legal fees, former Honeywell deferred compensation vested
upon change in control and other direct merger-related expenses incurred in the
period the merger was completed. All merger-related actions are substantially
complete.

    In 1999, we also recognized a pretax charge of $321 million for the costs of
actions designed to reposition principally the AlliedSignal businesses for
improved productivity and future profitability. These repositioning actions
included the organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to
strengthen market focus and simplify business structure; elimination of an
unprofitable product line, closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant
and rationalization of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our
Performance Polymers and Chemicals business; a reduction in the infrastructure
in our Turbocharging Systems business; elimination of two manufacturing
facilities in our Electronic Materials business; a plant closure and outsourcing
activity in our automotive Consumer Products Group business; and related and
general workforce reductions in all AlliedSignal businesses and our Industrial
Control business. The components of the charge included severance costs of
$140 million, asset impairments of $149 million, and other exit costs of
$32 million. Global workforce reductions consisted of approximately 5,100
manufacturing, administrative, and sales positions and are substantially
complete. Asset impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant and
equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively
marketed in the period of impairment. Other exit costs principally consisted of
environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant shutdowns. All
repositioning actions, excluding environmental remediation, are substantially
complete.

    The merger and repositioning actions committed to in 2000 and 1999 generated
pretax savings of over $270 million in 2000 principally from planned workforce
reductions and facility consolidations. We expect these actions to generate
pretax savings of over $600 million in 2001 and $780 million in 2002. Cash
expenditures for severance, other exit costs, and future period expenses
necessary to execute these actions will exceed $500 million and were
principally incurred in 2000. Such expenditures have been funded through
operating cash flows, proceeds from government required divestitures resulting
from the merger of AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell and sale of merger-
related, excess or duplicate facilities and equipment.

    We are currently formulating a detailed plan to effect further actions
designed to improve our competitiveness, productivity and future profitability.
The cost of these actions will result in a charge against earnings in the first
quarter of 2001.

                                       17





&lt;PAGE&gt;
    In 1998, we recognized a charge of $54 million related to productivity
initiatives which included workforce reductions of 1,200 employees and facility
consolidations principally in our Home and Building Control and Industrial
Control businesses. These actions were completed by December 31, 1999, with
substantially all reserve spending occurring in 1999.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    We are subject to various federal, state and local government requirements
relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general
matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent
unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that our handling, manufacture,
use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations
and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in
similar businesses, are a party to lawsuits and claims and have incurred
remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental
matters. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters
are likely to continue to arise in the future. We continually conduct studies,
individually at our owned sites, and jointly as a member of industry groups at
non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to
address environmental matters. It is our policy to record appropriate
liabilities for such matters when environmental assessments are made or remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of
these accruals is generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies.

    Remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were $75, $78 and $77
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and are currently estimated to be
approximately $69 million in 2001. We expect that we will be able to fund such
expenditures from operating cash flow. The timing of expenditures depends on a
number of factors, including regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.

    In 2000 we charged $110 million against pretax income for remedial response
and voluntary cleanup costs. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the recorded
liability for environmental matters was $386 and $349 million, respectively.
In addition, in 2000 and 1999 we incurred operating costs for ongoing
businesses of approximately $80 and $89 million, respectively, relating
to compliance with environmental regulations.

    Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate
costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they may be
significant to our consolidated results of operations. We do not expect that
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position.

    See &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of
Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and
contingencies, including those related to environmental matters.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates,
which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We
minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our
accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in &#39;Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 1 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

    Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our debt obligations. As described in &#39;Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data&#39; in Notes 16 and 18 of Notes

                                       18





&lt;PAGE&gt;
to Financial Statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use
interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce
borrowing costs.

    Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates
arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries and foreign
currency denominated receivables, payables, and firm commitments arising from
international transactions. We attempt to have such transaction exposures hedged
with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these
opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option
agreements with third parties. We also use derivative financial instruments to
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on the translated U.S. dollar value
of the net income for a number of foreign subsidiaries. Foreign currency forward
and option agreements used to hedge net income are marked-to-market, with gains
or losses recognized immediately in income. Our principal foreign currency
exposures relate to the Belgian franc, the French franc, the German mark
(collectively the Euro countries), the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and
the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2000, we held or had written foreign currency
forward and option agreements maturing through 2001.

    Derivative financial instruments expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency
exchange rates. We manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific
minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to
monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial
investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such
derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value
and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering
reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict
the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.

    The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for
interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate
one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the
potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments
based on a 10 percent increase in U.S. dollar per local currency exchange rates
across all maturities at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market
conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these
estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets.
The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be
considered projections of future events.

&lt;PAGE&gt;
OTHER MATTERS

LITIGATION

    Litton Litigation -- On March 13, 1990, Litton Systems, Inc. filed a legal
action against the former Honeywell in U.S. District Court, Central District of
California, Los Angeles, with claims that were subsequently split into two
separate cases. One alleges patent infringement under federal law for using an
ion-beam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the former Honeywell&#39;s ring
laser gyroscopes, and tortious interference under state law for interfering with
Litton&#39;s prospective advantage with customers and contractual relationships with
an inventor and his company, Ojai Research, Inc. The other case alleges
monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal antitrust laws by the
former Honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems containing ring laser
gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market. The former Honeywell generally
denied Litton&#39;s allegations in both cases. In the patent/tort case, the former
Honeywell also contested the validity as well as the infringement of the patent,
alleging, among other things, that the patent had been obtained by Litton&#39;s
inequitable conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

    In 1993 and 1995, trials were held in each case and juries initially awarded
Litton significant monetary damages. However, those verdicts were set aside by
the trial court judge who ordered, at a minimum, new trials on the issue of
damages in each case.

    Following cross-appeals by the parties of various issues to the Federal
Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court in the patent/tort case, it was remanded to
the trial court for further legal and perhaps factual review with respect to
both liability and damages. On September 23, 1999, the trial court issued
dispositive rulings in the case, granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for
Judgment as a Matter of Law and Summary Judgment on the Patent claims on various
grounds; granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law
on the state law claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence; and denying
Litton&#39;s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The trial court entered a final
judgment in Honeywell&#39;s favor on January 31, 2000, and Litton appealed that
judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 5,
2001, a three judge panel of the Federal Circuit court affirmed the trial
court&#39;s rulings granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter
of Law and Summary Judgment on the patent claims, agreeing that the former
Honeywell did not infringe. On the state law claims, the panel vacated the
jury&#39;s verdict in favor of Litton, reversed the trial court&#39;s grant of judgment
as a matter of law for the former Honeywell, and remanded the case to the trial
court for further proceedings under state law to resolve certain factual issues
that it held should have been submitted to the jury. Litton may now seek review
of this decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

    A retrial of damages in the antitrust case commenced October 29, 1998, and
on December 9, 1998, a jury returned a verdict against Honeywell for actual
damages in the amount of $250 million. Following post trial motions, on
September 24, 1999, the trial court issued rulings denying the former
Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Motion for New Trial and
Remittitur as they related to Litton Systems, Inc., but granting the former
Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law as it relates to Litton
Systems, Canada, Limited. The net effect of these rulings was to reduce the
existing judgment against the former Honeywell of $750 million to $660 million,
plus attorney fees and costs of approximately $35 million. We believe that there
is no factual or legal basis for the magnitude of the jury&#39;s award and believe
that it should be overturned. We also believe we have very strong arguments that
the liability portion of the jury verdict in the first antitrust trial was
erroneous. Both parties have appealed this judgment, as to both liability and
damages, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Execution of the
trial court&#39;s judgment is stayed pending resolution of the former Honeywell&#39;s
post-judgment motions and disposition of any appeals filed by the parties.

    Although it is not possible at this time to predict the result of any
further appeals in this case, potential does remain for an adverse outcome which
could be material to our financial position or results of operations. As a
result of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter, no provision has
been made in the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability.

    For a detailed discussion of this litigation, see &#39;Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#39; in Note 22 of Notes to the Financial
Statements.

    Shareowner Litigation -- Honeywell and seven of its officers were named as
defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey

                                       20





&lt;PAGE&gt;
(the Securities Law Complaints). The Securities Law Complaints principally
allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly
making false and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material
information concerning Honeywell&#39;s financial performance, thereby allegedly
causing the value of Honeywell&#39;s stock to be artificially inflated. The
purported class period for which damages are sought is December 20, 1999 to
June 19, 2000.

    In addition, Honeywell, seven of its officers and its Board of Directors
have been named as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action which
was filed on November 27, 2000 in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey (the Derivative Complaint). The Derivative Compliant
alleges a single claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical
allegations to those set forth in the Securities Law Complaints.

    We believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the Securities Law Complaints and the Derivative Complaint. Although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases, we expect to
prevail. However, an adverse outcome could be material to our financial position
or results of operations. No provision has been made in our financial statements
with respect to this contingent liability.

EURO CONVERSION

    On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
European Union&#39;s common currency (Euro). The transition period for the
introduction of the Euro is between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. We have
identified and are ensuring that all Euro conversion compliance issues are
addressed and do not expect any adverse consequences.

SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

    Sales to the U.S. Government, acting through its various departments and
agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $2,219, $2,383 and
$2,693 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. This included sales to the
Department of Defense (DoD), as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $1,548,
$1,415 and $1,658 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Sales to the DoD
accounted for 6.2, 6.0 and 7.0 percent of our total sales in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. We are affected by U.S. Government budget constraints for
defense and space programs. U.S. defense spending increased slightly in 2000 and
is also expected to increase slightly in 2001.

BACKLOG

    Our total backlog at year-end 2000 and 1999 was $8,094 and $8,736 million,
respectively. We anticipate that approximately $5,090 million of the 2000
backlog will be filled in 2001. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer&#39;s option.

INFLATION

    Highly competitive market conditions have minimized inflation&#39;s impact on
the selling prices of our products and the cost of our purchased materials. Cost
increases for materials and labor have generally been low, and productivity
enhancement programs, including Six Sigma initiatives, have largely offset any
impact.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, &#39;Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#39;, as amended (SFAS No. 133), is
effective for Honeywell as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires all
derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities,
measured at fair value. The accounting for gains or losses resulting from
changes in values of such derivatives depends on the use of the derivative and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. We estimate that, at January 1, 2001,
the effect on our consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS No. 133
will not be material.

                          HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. is a diversified technology and manufacturing
company, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services,
control technologies for buildings, homes and industry, automotive products,
power generation systems, specialty chemicals, fibers, plastics and electronic
and advanced materials. As described in Note 2, Honeywell International Inc. was
formed upon the merger of AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell Inc. The following is
a description of the significant accounting policies of Honeywell International
Inc.

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries in
which a controlling interest is maintained. All intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation.

    INVENTORIES -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using
the first-in, first-out or the average cost method and the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories.

    INVESTMENTS -- Investments in affiliates over which we have a significant
influence, but not a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Other investments are carried at market value, if readily
determinable, or cost.

    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the
straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of
10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery
and equipment.

    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS -- Goodwill represents the excess of
acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and
is amortized on a straight-line basis over appropriate periods up to 40 years.
Goodwill, net, was $5,600 and $4,282 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Accumulated amortization was $974 and $804 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    Other intangible assets includes patents, trademarks, customer lists and
other items amortized on a straight-line basis over appropriate periods up to
24 years. Other intangible assets, net, were $298 and $378 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $437 and
$398 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    LONG-LIVED ASSETS -- We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the
carrying amount of long-lived assets (including property, plant, and equipment,
goodwill and other intangible assets) whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. We also
continually evaluate the estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets and
periodically revise such estimates based on current events.

    SALES RECOGNITION -- Product and service sales are recognized when an
agreement of sale exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. Sales under long-term contracts in the Aerospace Solutions and
Automation &amp; Control segments are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method
measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the
units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for
anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses
become evident.

    ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES -- Environmental expenditures that relate to
current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that do not
provide future benefits, are expensed as incurred. Liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the
costs

                                       26

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

can be reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally no later
than the completion of feasibility studies.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -- Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S.
dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates effective during
the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a
component of Accumulated Other Nonowner Changes in shareowners&#39; equity. For
subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and
property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the
exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement
adjustments for these operations are included in net income.

    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- Interest rate swap, foreign currency forward and
option agreements are accounted for as a hedge of the related asset, liability,
firm commitment or anticipated transaction when designated and effective as a
hedge of such items. Agreements qualifying for hedge accounting are accounted
for as follows:

     Changes in the amount to be received or paid under interest rate swap
     agreements are recognized in Interest and Other Financial Charges.

     Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge
     assets, liabilities and net income are recognized in Other (Income)
     Expense.

     Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge net
     investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the Cumulative
     Foreign Exchange Translation Adjustment.

     Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge firm
     foreign currency commitments, and purchased foreign currency options used
     to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, are recognized in the
     measurement of the hedged transaction when the transaction occurs.

    Changes in the fair value of agreements not qualifying for hedge accounting
are recognized in Other (Income) Expense. Gains and losses on terminated
interest rate swap agreements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining
term of the agreement or the hedged liability.

    The carrying value of each agreement is reported in Accounts and Notes
Receivable, Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities, as
appropriate.

    INCOME TAXES -- Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary
differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax
reporting. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax
rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A
valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which
realization is not likely.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- Research and development costs for
company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred.
Such costs are classified as part of Cost of Goods Sold and were $818, $909 and
$876 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    EARNINGS PER SHARE -- Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding. All earnings per share data in this report
reflect earnings per share -- assuming dilution, unless otherwise indicated.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand
and on deposit and highly liquid, temporary cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.

    USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions

                                       27

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related
disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT -- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, &#39;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#39;, as
amended (SFAS No. 133), is effective for Honeywell as of January 1, 2001. SFAS
No. 133 requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets
or liabilities, measured at fair value. The accounting for gains or losses
resulting from changes in values of such derivatives depends on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. We estimate that, at
January 1, 2001, the effect on our consolidated financial statements of adopting
SFAS No. 133 will not be material.

NOTE 2 -- ALLIEDSIGNAL - HONEYWELL MERGER

    On December 1, 1999, AlliedSignal Inc. (AlliedSignal) and Honeywell Inc.
(former Honeywell) completed a merger under an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(Merger Agreement) dated as of June 4, 1999. Under the Merger Agreement, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AlliedSignal merged with and into the former
Honeywell. As a result of the merger, the former Honeywell has become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AlliedSignal. At the effective time of the merger
AlliedSignal was renamed Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell).

    The former Honeywell shareowners received 1.875 shares of Honeywell common
stock for each share of the former Honeywell common stock with cash paid in lieu
of any fractional shares. As a result, former Honeywell shareowners received
approximately 241 million shares of Honeywell common stock valued at
approximately $15 billion at the merger date. In addition, outstanding former
Honeywell employee stock options were converted at the same exchange factor into
options to purchase approximately 10 million shares of Honeywell common stock.

    The merger qualified as a tax-free reorganization and was accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. Accordingly, Honeywell&#39;s
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods prior to
the merger to include the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of the former Honeywell as though it had always been a part of Honeywell.

    There were no material transactions between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell prior to the merger and there were no material adjustments to conform
the accounting policies of the combining companies.

    The net sales and net income previously reported by the separate companies
and the combined amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Income are as follows:

NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITIONS

    In addition to the pooling-of-interests transaction discussed in Note 2, we
acquired businesses for an aggregate cost of $2,646, $1,314 and $1,191 million
in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The following table presents information
about the more significant acquisitions:

(1) Pittway Corporation designs, manufactures and distributes security and fire
    systems for homes and buildings.

(2) Johnson Matthey Electronics supplies wafer fabrication materials and
    interconnect products to the electronics and telecommunications industries.

(3) TriStar Aerospace Co. distributes fasteners, fastening systems and related
    hardware and provides customized inventory management services to original
    equipment manufacturers of aircraft and aircraft components, commercial
    airlines and aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities.

(4) Banner Aerospace distributes FAA-certified aircraft hardware principally to
    the commercial air transport and general aviation markets.

(5) Pharmaceutical Fine Chemicals manufactures and distributes active and
    intermediate pharmaceutical chemicals.

    All the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of
acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
net assets acquired, of $1,678, $678 and $883 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, was recorded as goodwill and is amortized over estimated useful
lives. In connection with these acquisitions the amounts recorded for
transaction costs and the costs of integrating the acquired businesses into
Honeywell were not material. The results of operations of the acquired
businesses have been included in the consolidated results of Honeywell from
their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma results for 2000, 1999 and
1998, assuming these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year,
would not be materially different from reported results.

NOTE 4 -- HONEYWELL-GENERAL ELECTRIC MERGER

    On October 22, 2000, Honeywell and General Electric Company (GE) entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) providing for a business
combination between Honeywell and GE. When the merger is effective, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of GE will be merged with and into Honeywell, and
Honeywell will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE and each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Honeywell will be converted into the right
to receive 1.055 shares of common stock of GE, with fractional shares paid in
cash. The merger, which was approved by Honeywell shareowners on January 10,
2001, is subject to certain remaining conditions, which include review or
approval of the transaction by various governmental authorities. GE and
Honeywell are working with regulatory agencies to complete the required reviews
or obtain required approvals so that the transaction can close as early as
possible in 2001. The Merger Agreement provides for payment of a $1.35 billion
termination fee by Honeywell under certain circumstances. In connection with the
execution of the Merger Agreement, Honeywell and GE entered into a stock option
agreement

pursuant to which Honeywell granted to GE an option to purchase up to 19.9
percent of Honeywell&#39;s outstanding shares of common stock. The option is
exercisable in the same circumstances under which Honeywell is required to pay
to GE the $1.35 billion termination fee.

NOTE 5 -- MERGER, REPOSITIONING AND OTHER CHARGES

    In 2000, we recognized a charge of $239 million related to announced global
workforce reductions in each of our reportable segments, costs to close a chip
package manufacturing plant and related workforce reductions in our Electronic
Materials business, and other asset impairments principally associated with the
completion of previously announced plant shut-downs in our Performance Polymers
and Chemicals business. The components of the charge included severance costs of
$151 million and asset impairments of $88 million. The workforce reductions
consisted of approximately 2,800 manufacturing and administrative positions and
are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of
2001. Asset impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant and
equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively
marketed in the period of impairment. Also, $46 million of accruals established
in 1999, principally for severance, were returned to income in 2000 due to
higher than expected voluntary employee attrition (approximately 650 positions)
resulting in reduced severance liabilities principally in our Automation &amp;
Control and Aerospace Solutions reportable segments. We also recognized a charge
of $99 million in equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies for costs to
close an affiliate&#39;s chemical manufacturing operations. The components of the
charge included severance costs of $6 million, asset impairments of $53 million,
and other environmental exit costs and period expenses of $40 million.

    In 1999, upon completion of the merger between AlliedSignal and the former
Honeywell, we recognized a charge of $642 million for the cost of actions
designed to improve our combined competitiveness, productivity and future
profitability. The merger-related actions included the elimination of redundant
corporate offices and functional administrative overhead; elimination of
redundant and excess facilities and workforce in our combined aerospace
businesses; adoption of six sigma productivity initiatives at the former
Honeywell businesses; and, the transition to a global shared services model. The
components of the charge included severance costs of $342 million, asset
impairments of $108 million, other exit costs of $57 million and merger-related
transaction and period expenses of $135 million. Planned global workforce
reductions consisted of approximately 6,500 administrative and manufacturing
positions and are substantially complete. Asset impairments were principally
related to the elimination of redundant or excess corporate and aerospace
facilities and equipment. Other exit costs were related to lease terminations
and contract cancellation losses negotiated or subject to reasonable estimation
at year-end. Merger-related transaction and period expenses consisted of
investment banking and legal fees, former Honeywell deferred compensation vested
upon change in control and other direct merger-related expenses incurred in the
period the merger was completed. All merger-related actions are substantially
complete.

    In 1999, we also recognized a charge of $321 million for the cost of actions
designed to reposition principally the AlliedSignal businesses for improved
productivity and future profitability. These repositioning actions included the
organizational realignment of our aerospace businesses to strengthen market
focus and simplify business structure; elimination of an unprofitable product
line, closing of a wax refinery and carbon materials plant and rationalization
of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in our Performance Polymers and
Chemicals business; a reduction in the infrastructure in our Turbocharging
Systems business; elimination of two manufacturing facilities in our Electronic
Materials business; a plant closure and outsourcing activity in our automotive
Consumer Products Group business; and related and general workforce reductions
in all AlliedSignal businesses and our Industrial Control business. The
components of the charge included severance costs of $140 million, asset
impairments of $149 million, and other exit costs of $32 million. Global
workforce reductions consisted of approximately 5,100 manufacturing,
administrative, and sales positions and are substantially complete. Asset
impairments were principally related to manufacturing plant and

equipment held for sale and capable of being taken out of service and actively
marketed in the period of impairment. Other exit costs principally consisted of
environmental exit costs associated with chemical plant shutdowns. All
repositioning actions, excluding environmental remediation, are substantially
complete.

    In 2000, we identified certain business units and manufacturing facilities
as non-core to our business strategy. As a result of this assessment, we
implemented cost reduction initiatives and conducted discussions with potential
acquirers of these businesses and assets. As part of this process, we evaluated
the businesses and assets for possible impairment. As a result of our analysis,
we recognized impairment charges of $245 and $165 million principally related to
the write-down of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable
intangible assets of our Friction Materials business and a chemical
manufacturing facility, respectively. We recognized other charges consisting of
probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities of $87 million, and
contract claims, merger related period expenses, other contingencies, and
write-offs of tangible assets removed from service, including inventory,
totaling $140 million. In addition, we recognized a charge of $37 million in
equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies for costs principally related to
an equity investee&#39;s customer claims.

    In 1999, we recognized other charges consisting of losses on aerospace
engine maintenance contracts and a contract cancellation penalty totaling $45
million, customer and employee claims of $69 million, contract settlements and
contingent liabilities of $18 million, and other write-offs principally related
to tangible and intangible assets removed from service, including inventory, of
$152 million. We also recognized a $36 million charge resulting from an other
than temporary decline in value of an equity investment due to a significant
deterioration in market conditions and a $4 million charge related to an equity
investee&#39;s severance action involving approximately 220 employees. The
investee&#39;s severance action was completed by December 31, 1999.

    In 1998, we recognized a charge of $54 million related to productivity
initiatives which included workforce reductions and facility consolidations
principally in our Home and Building Control and Industrial Control businesses.
The components of the charge included severance costs of $46 million and other
exit costs of $8 million. Global workforce reductions included approximately
1,200 sales, marketing, manufacturing and other administrative positions. Other
exit costs consisted of lease termination penalties to consolidate field office
locations and other period costs incurred to rationalize product lines. These
actions were completed by December 31, 1999, with substantially all reserve
spending occurring in 1999.

NOTE 6 -- GAIN ON SALE OF NON-STRATEGIC BUSINESSES

    In 2000, as a result of a government mandate in connection with the merger
of AlliedSignal and the former Honeywell, we sold the TCAS product line of the
former Honeywell. We received approximately $215 million in cash resulting in a
pretax gain of $112 million. The TCAS product line had annual sales of
approximately $100 million.

    In 1999, we sold our Laminate Systems business for approximately $425
million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of $106 million. The Laminate Systems
business had annual sales of about $400 million.

    In April 1999, we reached an agreement with Tyco International Ltd. (Tyco)
and AMP Incorporated (AMP), settling AMP&#39;s claim to the gain we would realize on
the disposition of our investment in AMP common stock. We made a payment to AMP
of $50 million, and the parties released all claims that they had against each
other relating to AMP. Subsequently, we converted our investment in AMP common
stock into Tyco common stock and sold the Tyco common stock for net cash
proceeds of $1.2 billion resulting in a pretax gain of $268 million, net of the
settlement payment.

    The amount of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards available at
December 31, 2000 was $111 million. The majority of these loss carryforwards
were generated by certain subsidiaries prior to their acquisition in 1997 and
have expiration dates through the year 2011. The use of pre-acquisition
operating losses is subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
We do not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the
carryforwards prior to their expiration. We also have foreign net operating
losses of $595 million which are available to reduce future income tax payments
in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules.

    Deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.1 billion
of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies, which are considered
to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of
tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.

    Cash payments of income taxes during the years 2000, 1999 and 1998 were
$442, $625 and $729 million, respectively.

    We maintain $2 billion of bank revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks which are comprised of: (a) a $1 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement and
(b) a $1 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement. The credit agreements are maintained
for general corporate purposes including support for the issuance of commercial
paper. We had no balance outstanding under either agreement at December 31,
2000.

    Neither of the credit agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends and
neither contain financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary
conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the
credit agreements would prevent any further borrowings and would generally
require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under such credit
agreements. Such events of default include (a) non-payment of credit agreement
debt and interest thereon, (b) non-compliance with the terms of the credit
agreement covenants, (c) cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances,
(d) bankruptcy and (e) defaults upon obligations under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate
its commitment to lend under the credit agreements if any person or group
acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of our voting stock or,
during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the
beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors
(the Board).

    Loans under the Five-Year Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no
later than December 2, 2004. We have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.065
percent per annum on the aggregate commitment for the Five-Year Credit
Agreement, subject to increase or decrease in the event of changes in our
long-term debt ratings.

    Interest on borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement would be
determined, at our option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest
of the floating base rate of the agent bank, 0.5 percent above the average CD
rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate or (c) the average
Eurocurrency rate of three reference banks plus 0.135 percent (applicable
margin). The applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate on the Five-Year
Credit Agreement is subject to increase or decrease if our long-term debt
ratings change.

    The commitments under the 364-Day Credit Agreement terminate on November 29,
2001. Annually, prior to the Agreement&#39;s anniversary date, we may request that
the termination date of the 364-Day Credit Agreement be extended by 364 days. We
have agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.055 percent per annum on the aggregate
commitment for the 364-Day Credit Agreement.

    Interest on borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement would be

NOTE 18 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed
to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates,
which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We
minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

    Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk by
adjusting our ratio of fixed to floating interest rates payable on our
outstanding debt. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, interest rate swap agreements
effectively changed $1,600 and $850 million, respectively, of fixed rate debt at
an average rate of 7.1 and 6.6 percent, respectively, to LIBOR and commercial
paper based floating rate debt. Other interest rate swaps at December 31, 1999
effectively changed $250 million of LIBOR and commercial paper based floating
rate swaps and debt to fixed rate swaps and debt with an average fixed rate of
6.3 percent. Our interest rate swaps mature through the year 2007.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

    Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates
arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign
currency denominated receivables, payables, and firm commitments arising from
international transactions. We attempt to have such transaction exposure hedged
with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these
opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option
agreements with third parties. We also use derivative financial instruments to
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements on the translated U.S. dollar value
of the net income for a number of foreign subsidiaries. Foreign currency forward
and option agreements used to hedge net income are marked-to-market, with gains
or losses recognized immediately in income. Our principal foreign currency
exposures relate to the Belgian franc, the French franc, the German mark
(collectively the Euro countries), the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and
the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2000, we held or had written foreign currency
forward and option agreements maturing through 2001.

    Derivative financial instruments expose us to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency
exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through
specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and
procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are
substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using
such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.

    The values of our outstanding derivative financial instruments at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 follows:

(1) The fair value of financial instruments is based on quoted market prices or
    other valuation techniques, as appropriate.

    Other financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at amounts, which approximate fair values, are certain debt instruments.
The carrying value of long-term debt and related current maturities (excluding
capitalized leases of $30 and $36 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively) were $4,291 and $2,705 million and the fair values were $4,517 and
$2,702 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fair values are
estimated based on the quoted market price for the issues (if traded) or based
on current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturity and
characteristics.

NOTE 19 -- CAPITAL STOCK

    We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with
a par value of one dollar. Common shareowners are entitled to receive such
dividends as may be declared by the Board, are entitled to one vote per share,
and are entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all the
assets of Honeywell which are available for distribution to the common
shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights.

outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or
assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to dividends or the
repurchase or redemption of common stock.

    On July 21, 2000, our Board authorized a share repurchase program to
purchase up to 40 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other
factors. During 2000, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for
$166 million in connection with our share repurchase program. As a result of the
pending merger with General Electric Company (See Note 4), Honeywell rescinded
its share repurchase program effective October 21, 2000.

    We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and
the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. As of December 31, 2000,
there was no preferred stock outstanding.

NOTE 22 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    LITTON LITIGATION -- On March 13, 1990, Litton Systems, Inc. (Litton) filed
a legal action against the former Honeywell in U.S. District Court, Central
District of California, Los Angeles (the trial court) with claims that were
subsequently split into two separate cases. One alleges patent infringement
under

                                       42





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                          HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

federal law for using an ion-beam process to coat mirrors incorporated in the
former Honeywell&#39;s ring laser gyroscopes, and tortious interference under state
law for interfering with Litton&#39;s prospective advantage with customers and
contractual relationships with an inventor and his company, Ojai Research, Inc.
The other case alleges monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal
antitrust laws by the former Honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems
containing ring laser gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market. The former
Honeywell generally denied Litton&#39;s allegations in both cases. In the
patent/tort case, the former Honeywell also contested the validity as well as
the infringement of the patent, alleging, among other things, that the patent
had been obtained by Litton&#39;s inequitable conduct before the United States
Patent and Trademark Office.

    Patent/Tort Case -- U.S. District Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer presided over
a three-month patent infringement and tortious interference trial in 1993. On
August 31, 1993, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Litton, awarding damages
against the former Honeywell in the amount of $1.2 billion on three claims. The
former Honeywell filed post-trial motions contesting the verdict and damage
award. On January 9, 1995, the trial court set them all aside, ruling, among
other things, that the Litton patent was invalid due to obviousness,
unenforceable because of Litton&#39;s inequitable conduct before the Patent and
Trademark Office, and in any case, not infringed by the former Honeywell&#39;s
current process. It further ruled that Litton&#39;s state tort claims were not
supported by sufficient evidence. The trial court also held that if its rulings
concerning liability were vacated or reversed on appeal, the former Honeywell
should at least be granted a new trial on the issue of damages because the
jury&#39;s award was inconsistent with the clear weight of the evidence and based
upon a speculative damage study.

    The trial court&#39;s rulings were appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, and on July 3, 1996, in a two to one split decision, a three
judge panel of that court reversed the trial court&#39;s rulings of patent
invalidity, unenforceability and non-infringement, and also found the former
Honeywell to have violated California law by intentionally interfering with
Litton&#39;s consultant contracts and customer prospects. However, the panel upheld
two trial court rulings favorable to the former Honeywell, namely that the
former Honeywell was entitled to a new trial for damages on all claims, and also
to a grant of intervening patent rights which are to be defined and quantified
by the trial court. After unsuccessfully requesting a rehearing of the panel&#39;s
decision by the full Federal Circuit appellate court, the former Honeywell filed
a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 26, 1996, seeking review of
the panel&#39;s decision. In the interim, Litton filed a motion and briefs with the
trial court seeking injunctive relief against the former Honeywell&#39;s commercial
ring laser gyroscope sales. After the former Honeywell and certain aircraft
manufacturers filed briefs and made oral arguments opposing the injunction, the
trial court denied Litton&#39;s motion on public interest grounds on December 23,
1996, and then scheduled the patent/tort damages retrial for May 6, 1997.

    On March 17, 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the former Honeywell&#39;s
petition for review and vacated the July 3, 1996 Federal Circuit panel decision.
The case was remanded to the Federal Circuit panel for reconsideration in light
of a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Warner-Jenkinson vs.
Hilton Davis case, which refined the law concerning patent infringement under
the doctrine of equivalents. On March 21, 1997, Litton filed a notice of appeal
to the Federal Circuit of the trial court&#39;s December 23, 1996 decision to deny
injunctive relief, but the Federal Circuit stayed any briefing or consideration
of that matter until such time as it completed its reconsideration of liability
issues ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

    The liability issues were argued before the same three judge Federal Circuit
panel on September 30, 1997. On April 7, 1998, the panel issued its decision:

    (i)  affirming the trial court&#39;s ruling that the former Honeywell&#39;s hollow
         cathode and RF ion-beam processes do not literally infringe the
         asserted claims of Litton&#39;s &#39;849 reissue patent (Litton&#39;s patent);

   (ii)  vacating the trial court&#39;s ruling that the former Honeywell&#39;s RF
         ion-beam process does not infringe the asserted claims of Litton&#39;s
         patent under the doctrine of equivalents, but also

                 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

         vacating the jury&#39;s verdict on that issue and remanding that issue to
         the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the
         Warner-Jenkinson decision;

  (iii)  vacating the jury&#39;s verdict that the former Honeywell&#39;s hollow
         cathode process infringes the asserted claims of Litton&#39;s patent
         under the doctrine of equivalents and remanding that issue to the
         trial court for further proceedings;

    (iv) reversing the trial court&#39;s ruling with respect to the torts of
         intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional
         interference with prospective economic advantage, but also vacating the
         jury&#39;s verdict on that issue, and remanding the issue to the trial
         court for further proceedings in accordance with California state law;

    (v)  affirming the trial court&#39;s grant of a new trial to the former
         Honeywell on damages for all claims, if necessary;

    (vi) affirming the trial court&#39;s order granting intervening rights to the
         former Honeywell in the patent claim;

   (vii) reversing the trial court&#39;s ruling that the asserted claims of
         Litton&#39;s patent were invalid due to obviousness and reinstating the
         jury&#39;s verdict on that issue; and

  (viii) reversing the trial court&#39;s determination that Litton had obtained
         Litton&#39;s patent through inequitable conduct.

    Litton&#39;s request for a rehearing of the panel&#39;s decision by the full Federal
Circuit court was denied and its appeal of the denial of an injunction was
dismissed. The case was remanded to the trial court for further legal and
perhaps factual review. The parties filed motions with the trial court to
dispose of the remanded issues as matters of law, which were argued before the
trial court on July 26, 1999. On September 23, 1999, the trial court issued
dispositive rulings in the case, granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for
Judgment as a Matter of Law and Summary Judgment on the patent claims on various
grounds; granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law
on the state law claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence; and denying
Litton&#39;s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The trial court entered a final
judgment in Honeywell&#39;s favor on January 31, 2000, and Litton appealed that
judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

    On February 5, 2001, a three judge panel of the Federal Circuit court
affirmed the trial court&#39;s rulings granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for
Judgment as a Matter of Law and Summary Judgment on the patent claims, agreeing
that the former Honeywell did not infringe. On the state law claims, the panel
vacated the jury&#39;s verdict in favor of Litton, reversed the trial court&#39;s grant
of judgment as a matter of law for the former Honeywell, and remanded the case
to the trial court for further proceedings under state law to resolve certain
factual issues that it held should have been submitted to the jury. Litton may
now attempt to seek review of this decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

    When preparing for the patent/tort damages retrial that was scheduled for
May 1997, Litton had submitted a revised damage study to the trial court,
seeking damages as high as $1.9 billion. We do not expect that if Litton files
an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court it will ultimately succeed. We do not expect
that in the absence of any patent infringement Litton will be able to prove any
tortious conduct by the former Honeywell under state law that interfered with
Litton&#39;s contracts or business prospects. We believe that it is reasonably
possible that no damages will ultimately be awarded to Litton.

    Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether Litton will seek
review by the U.S. Supreme Court and whether such an appeal would succeed,
potential does remain for an adverse outcome which could be material to our
financial position or results of operations. We believe however, that any
potential award of damages for an adverse judgment of infringement or
interference should be based upon a reasonable royalty reflecting the value of
the ion-beam coating process, and further that such an award would not be
material to our financial position or results of operations. As a result of the
uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter, no provision has been made in
the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability.

    Antitrust Case -- Preparations for, and conduct of, the trial in the
antitrust case have generally followed the completion of comparable proceedings
in the patent/tort case. The antitrust trial did not begin until November 20,
1995. Judge Pfaelzer also presided over the trial, but it was held before a
different jury. At the close of evidence and before jury deliberations began,
the trial court dismissed, for failure of proof, Litton&#39;s contentions that the
former Honeywell had illegally monopolized and attempted to monopolize by:

    (i) engaging in below-cost predatory pricing;

   (ii) tying and bundling product offerings under packaged pricing;

  (iii) misrepresenting its products and disparaging Litton products; and

   (iv) acquiring the Sperry Avionics business in 1986.

    On February 2, 1996, the case was submitted to the jury on the remaining
allegations that the former Honeywell had illegally monopolized and attempted to
monopolize by:

    (i) entering into certain long-term exclusive dealing and penalty
        arrangements with aircraft manufacturers and airlines to exclude Litton
        from the commercial aircraft market, and

   (ii) failing to provide Litton with access to proprietary software used in
        the cockpits of certain business jets.

    On February 29, 1996, the jury returned a $234 million single damages
verdict against the former Honeywell for illegal monopolization, which verdict
would have been automatically trebled. On March 1, 1996, the jury indicated that
it was unable to reach a verdict on damages for the attempt to monopolize claim,
and a mistrial was declared as to that claim.

    The former Honeywell subsequently filed a motion for judgment as a matter of
law and a motion for a new trial, contending, among other things, that the
jury&#39;s partial verdict should be overturned because the former Honeywell was
prejudiced at trial, and Litton failed to prove essential elements of liability
or submit competent evidence to support its speculative, all-or-nothing
$298.5 million damage claim. Litton filed motions for entry of judgment and
injunctive relief. On July 24, 1996, the trial court denied the former
Honeywell&#39;s alternative motions for judgment as a matter of law or a complete
new trial, but concluded that Litton&#39;s damage study was seriously flawed and
granted the former Honeywell a retrial on damages only. The court also denied
Litton&#39;s two motions. At that time, Judge Pfaelzer was expected to conduct the
retrial of antitrust damages sometime following the retrial of patent/tort
damages. However, after the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the patent/tort case to
the Federal Circuit in March 1997, Litton moved to have the trial court
expeditiously schedule the antitrust damages retrial. In September 1997, the
trial court rejected that motion, indicating that it wished to know the outcome
of the current patent/tort appeal before scheduling retrials of any type.

    Following the April 7, 1998 Federal Circuit panel decision in the
patent/tort case, Litton again petitioned the trial court to schedule the
retrial of antitrust damages. The trial court tentatively scheduled the trial to
commence in the fourth quarter of 1998, and reopened limited discovery and other
pretrial preparations. Litton then filed another antitrust damage claim of
nearly $300 million.

    The damages only retrial began October 29, 1998 before Judge Pfaelzer and a
new jury. On December 9, 1998, the jury returned verdicts against the former
Honeywell totaling $250 million, $220 million of which is in favor of Litton and
$30 million of which is in favor of its sister corporation, Litton Systems,
Canada, Limited.

    On January 27, 1999, the court vacated its prior mistrial ruling with
respect to the attempt to monopolize claim and entered a treble damages judgment
in the total amount of $750 million for actual and attempted monopolization. The
former Honeywell filed appropriate post-judgment motions with the trial court
and Litton filed motions seeking to add substantial attorney&#39;s fees and costs to
the judgment. A hearing on the post-judgment motions was held before the trial
court on May 20, 1999. On September 24, 1999, the trial court issued rulings
denying the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Motion
for New Trial and Remittitur as they related to Litton Systems Inc., but

granting the former Honeywell&#39;s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law as it
relates to Litton Systems, Canada, Limited. The net effect of these rulings was
to reduce the existing judgment against the former Honeywell of $750 million to
$660 million, plus attorney fees and costs of approximately $35 million. Both
parties have appealed the judgment, as to both liability and damages, to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Execution of the trial court&#39;s
judgment is stayed pending resolution of the former Honeywell&#39;s post-judgment
motions and the disposition of any appeals filed by the parties.

    We expect to obtain substantial relief from the current adverse judgment in
the antitrust case by an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, based upon sound
substantive and procedural legal grounds. We believe that there was no factual
or legal basis for the magnitude of the jury&#39;s award in the damages retrial and
that, as was the case in the first trial, the jury&#39;s award should be overturned.
We also believe there are serious questions concerning the identity and nature
of the business arrangements and conduct which were found by the first antitrust
jury in 1996 to be anti-competitive and damaging to Litton, and the verdict of
liability should be overturned as a matter of law.

    Although it is not possible at this time to predict the result of the
appeals, potential remains for an adverse outcome which could be material to our
financial position or results of operations. As a result of the uncertainty
regarding the outcome of this matter, no provision has been made in the
financial statements with respect to this contingent liability. We also believe
that it would be inappropriate for Litton to obtain recovery of the same
damages, e.g. losses it suffered due to the former Honeywell&#39;s sales of ring
laser gyroscope-based inertial systems to OEMs and airline customers, under
multiple legal theories, claims, and cases, and that eventually any duplicative
recovery would be eliminated from the antitrust and patent/tort cases.

    SHAREOWNER LITIGATION -- Honeywell and seven of its officers were named as
defendants in several purported class action lawsuits filed in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey (the Securities Law Complaints).
The Securities Law Complaints principally allege that the defendants violated
federal securities laws by purportedly making false and misleading statements
and by failing to disclose material information concerning Honeywell&#39;s financial
performance, thereby allegedly causing the value of Honeywell&#39;s stock to be
artifically inflated. The purported class period for which damages are sought is
December 20, 1999 to June 19, 2000.

    In addition, Honeywell, seven of its officers and its Board have been named
as defendants in a purported shareowner derivative action which was filed on
November 27, 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey (the Derivative Complaint). The Derivative Complaint alleges a single
claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on nearly identical allegations to
those set forth in the Securities Law Complaints.

    We believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the Securities Law Complaints and the Derivative Complaint. Although it is not
possible at this time to predict the result of these cases, we expect to
prevail. However, an adverse outcome could be material to our financial position
or results of operations. No provision has been made in our financial statements
with respect to this contingent liability.

    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -- In accordance with our accounting policy (see
Note 1), liabilities are recorded for environmental matters generally no later
than the completion of feasibility studies. Although we do not currently possess
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of the liabilities to
be recorded upon future completion of studies, they may be significant to the
consolidated results of operations, but we do not expect that they will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. The liabilities
for environmental costs recorded in Accrued Liabilities and Other Liabilities at
December 31, 2000 were $171 and $215 million, respectively, and at December 31,
1999 were $104 and $245 million, respectively.

    OTHER MATTERS -- We are subject to a number of other lawsuits,
investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising
out of the conduct of our business. With respect to all these other matters,
including those relating to commercial transactions, government contracts,
product

liability and non-environmental health and safety matters, while the ultimate
results of these lawsuits, investigations and claims cannot be determined, we do
not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

    We have issued or are a party to various direct and indirect guarantees,
bank letters of credit and customer guarantees. We do not expect that these
guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position.

NOTE 23 -- PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

    We maintain pension plans covering the majority of our employees and
retirees, and postretirement benefit plans for retirees that include health care
benefits and life insurance coverage. Pension benefits for substantially all
U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, defined benefit pension
plans. Employees in foreign countries, who are not U.S. citizens, are covered by
various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be
defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. Our retiree medical plans
cover U.S. and Canadian employees who retire with pension eligibility for
hospital, professional and other medical services. Most of the U.S. retiree
medical plans require deductibles and copayments and virtually all are
integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on
coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. The retiree medical and life
insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our general
assets.

    Net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs (income) include
the following components:

NOTE 24 -- SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, &#39;Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#39; (SFAS No. 131), establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments. The following
information is provided in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 131 and
is consistent with how business results are reported internally to management.

    We globally manage our business operations through strategic business units
(SBUs) offering products and services to the aerospace, automation and control,
chemicals, and automotive industries. Based on similar economic and operational
characteristics, our SBUs are aggregated into the following four reportable
segments:

     Aerospace Solutions includes Engines &amp; Systems (auxiliary power units;
     propulsion engines; environmental control systems; engine controls; and
     power generation systems); Aerospace Electronic Systems (flight safety
     communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems; aircraft and
     airfield lighting; and advanced systems and instruments); Aerospace
     Services (repair and overhaul services; hardware; logistics; and management
     and technical services); and Aircraft Landing Systems (aircraft wheels and
     brakes).

     Automation &amp; Control includes Home and Building Control (controls for
     heating, ventilating, humidification and air-conditioning equipment;
     energy-efficient lighting controls; home consumer products; security and
     fire alarm systems; home automation systems; and building management
     systems and services); and Industrial Control (systems for the automation
     and control of process operations; solid-state sensors for position,
     pressure, air flow, temperature and current; precision electromechanical
     switches; control products; advanced vision-based sensors; and fiber-optic
     components).

     Performance Materials includes Performance Polymers and Chemicals (fibers;
     plastic resins; specialty films; intermediate chemicals; fluorine-based
     products; pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals; specialty waxes,
     adhesives and sealants; and process technology); and Electronic Materials
     (wafer fabrication materials and services; advanced circuits; and amorphous
     metals).

     Power &amp; Transportation Products includes Transportation and Power Systems
     (turbochargers; charge-air coolers; portable power systems; air brake and
     anti-lock braking systems); the Consumer Products Group (car care products
     including anti-freeze, filters, spark plugs, cleaners, waxes and
     additives); and Friction Materials (friction material and related brake
     system components).

    The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1. We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, which excludes
general corporate unallocated expenses, gains on sales of non-strategic
businesses, equity income, other (income) expense, interest and other financial
charges, merger, repositioning and other charges and other. We do not
disaggregate assets on a products and services basis for internal management
reporting and, therefore, such information is not presented. Intersegment sales
approximate market and are not significant. Reportable segment data were as
follows:

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREOWNERS OF
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

    In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
Item 14(a)(1) on page 63 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#39;s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Honeywell Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total sales of $8,426.7
million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Those statements were audited by
other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed herein, insofar as it related to the amounts included for Honeywell
Inc., is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

To the Shareowners of Honeywell Inc.:

    We have audited the statements of financial position of Honeywell Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998, and the related statements of income,
shareowners&#39; equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not separately
included herein). These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company&#39;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

    We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Honeywell Inc. and subsidiaries at December
31, 1998 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

(1) Options are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which assumes
    a historic five-year average volatility of 32.25 percent, the average
    dividend yield for the three years ended December 31, 2000 (1.43 percent), a
    6.5 percent risk-free rate of return (based on the average zero coupon
    five-year U.S. Treasury note yield for the month of grant), and an expected
    option life of 5.0 years based on past experience. No adjustments are made
    for non-transferability or risk of forfeiture. Options will have no actual
    value unless, and then only to the extent that, the common stock price
    appreciates from the grant date to the exercise date. If the grant date
    present values are realized, total shareowner value will have appreciated by
    approximately $14.6 billion, and the value of the granted options reflected
    in the table will be less than 0.09 percent of the total shareowner
    appreciation.

(2) Vests 40 percent on January 1, 2001 and 30 percent on each of January 1,
    2002 and 2003.

EMPLOYMENT AND TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS

    Mr. Bonsignore&#39;s employment agreement provides for his employment as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2004. During the term
of the agreement, Mr. Bonsignore will have an annual salary of at least
$1,500,000 and will have an annual target bonus equal to 100 percent of base
salary. If his employment is terminated without good cause, he will be entitled
to a severance payment of three times his annual salary and bonus.

    When Mr. Ferrari became President of Honeywell Europe in 1992, he entered
into an employment agreement with Honeywell Europe that provided for certain
salary and benefits in accordance with Belgian law. Mr. Ferrari&#39;s current
position is considered to be an international assignment under his Belgian
employment contract; therefore, the contract remains in effect until his
retirement from Honeywell. As an executive of Honeywell Inc., Mr. Ferrari was
also a party to a change of control agreement, which remains in effect until
September 2002. Under this agreement, he is entitled to a lump sum payment of
three times his salary and target incentive bonus if either his employment is
terminated (other than for cause) or his duties are diminished.

    Under the Severance Plan for Senior Executives, the current executive
officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (other than Messrs. Bonsignore
and Ferrari) would be entitled to

                                       59





&lt;PAGE&gt;
payments equivalent to base salary and annual incentive bonus (and continuation
of certain benefits, such as group life and medical insurance coverage) for a
period of 36 months if their employment is terminated other than for &#39;gross
cause&#39; (which includes fraud and criminal conduct). The payments would be made
in a lump sum following a change in control. The Severance Plan provides for an
additional payment sufficient to eliminate the effect of any applicable excise
tax on severance payments in excess of an amount determined under Section 280G
of the Internal Revenue Code. Payments subject to the excise tax would not be
deductible by Honeywell.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

    The following table illustrates the estimated annual pension benefits which
would be provided on retirement at age 65 under Honeywell&#39;s retirement program
and an unfunded supplemental retirement plan, after applicable deductions for
Social Security benefits, to salaried employees having specified average annual
remuneration and years of service.

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

    The benefit amounts shown in the Pension Table are computed on a straight
life annuity basis. At January 1, 2001, the following individuals had the
indicated number of years of credited service for pension purposes: Mr.
Bonsignore, 31; Mr. Johnson, 6; Mr. Kreindler, 9; and Mr. Wallman, 5. Mr.
Ferrari has 40 years of service, but is covered under a separate Belgian pension
arrangement described below.

    The amounts in the Salary and Bonus columns of the Summary Compensation
Table would be included in computing remuneration for pension purposes as well
as any payroll based reward and recognition awards. Average annual remuneration
under the Pension Plan is calculated based on the highest paid 60 consecutive
months of an employee&#39;s last 120 months of employment.

    Under his employment agreement, Mr. Bonsignore is entitled to receive during
his lifetime, commencing on retirement, Honeywell facilities and services
comparable to those provided prior to his retirement, and a retirement benefit
equivalent to 60 percent of final average compensation (based on his highest
three years of salary and bonus) payable annually for life. Benefits under his
agreement will be reduced by any retirement benefits payable under Honeywell&#39;s
retirement and supplemental retirement plans.

    Mr. Ferrari is covered by the Belgian pension arrangement, which provides a
benefit of 55 percent of final average compensation after 30 years of service,
through a combination of the plan and equivalent pension plans in other
countries. This arrangement also provides for an additional benefit of 15
percent of final average compensation which is funded by contributions from Mr.
Ferrari.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

    Directors who are employees of Honeywell receive no compensation for service
on the Board. Each non-employee director receives an annual Board retainer of
$65,000, of which $20,000 is automatically credited to the director&#39;s account in
the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors in the form of common
stock equivalents (which are only payable after termination of Board service).
They also receive a fee of $2,000 for Board meetings attended on any day (ten
during 2000), an annual retainer of $7,000 for each Board Committee served, and
an additional Committee Chair retainer of $5,000 for the Audit and Management
Development and Compensation Committees and $3,000 for all other Board
Committees. While no fees are generally paid for attending Committee meetings, a
$1,000 fee is paid for attendance at a Committee meeting, or other extraordinary
meeting related to Board business which occurs apart from a Board meeting.
Non-employee directors are also

                                       60





&lt;PAGE&gt;
provided with $350,000 in business travel accident insurance and are eligible to
elect $100,000 in term life insurance and medical and dental coverage for
themselves and their eligible dependents.

    Directors may elect to defer, until a specified calendar year or retirement
from the Board, all or any portion of their annual retainers and fees that are
not automatically deferred and to have such compensation credited to their
account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts credited either accrue
interest (11 percent for 2001) or are valued as if invested in common stock
equivalents or one of the other funds available to participants in our savings
plan. Amounts deferred in a common stock account earn amounts equivalent to
dividends. Upon a change of control, a director will be entitled to a lump-sum
payment of all deferred amounts.

    Under the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, each new director receives
a one-time grant of 3,000 shares of common stock, which are subject to transfer
restrictions until the director&#39;s service terminates with the consent of a
majority of the Board, provided termination occurs at or after 65. During the
restricted period, the director is entitled to one-fifth of the shares granted
for each year of service (up to five). However, the shares will be forfeited if
the director&#39;s service terminates (other than for death or disability) prior to
the end of the restricted period. The Plan also provides for an annual grant to
each director of options to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock at 100 percent
of the fair market value on the date of grant. Option grants vest in cumulative
installments of 40 percent on April 1 of the year following the grant date and
an additional 30 percent on April 1 of each of the next two years.

MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

    The primary functions of the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors are to review and recommend the compensation
arrangements for officers; approve compensation arrangements for other senior
level employees; consider matters related to management development and
succession and recommend individuals for election as officers; and review or
take such other action as may be required in connection with the bonus, stock
and other benefit plans of Honeywell and its subsidiaries. The members of the
Committee are: Robert P. Luciano (Chair), Hans W. Becherer, Gordon M. Bethune,
Bruce Karatz, Ivan G. Seidenberg and John R. Stafford.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

STOCK OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS

    As of December 31, 2000, State Street Bank and Trust Company, 225 Franklin
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02101 held 69,227,941 shares or approximately 8.6
percent of the outstanding common stock as trustee of certain of Honeywell&#39;s
savings plans. Under the terms of the plans, State Street is required to vote
shares attributable to any participant in accordance with instructions received
from the participant and to vote all shares for which it does not receive
instructions in the same ratio as the shares for which instructions were
received. State Street disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares referred to
above. State Street also held 15,430,034 shares, or approximately 1.9 percent of
the outstanding common stock in various other fiduciary capacities.

    As of December 31, 2000, AXA or its affiliates, including the Mutuelles AXA,
AXA Financial, Inc., Alliance Capital Management L.P. and The Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States beneficially owned 42,369,312 shares of
common stock (including 379,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
options), representing approximately 5.2 percent of the outstanding common
stock. The address of AXA is 25, Avenue Matignon, 75008 Paris, France, and the
address of AXA Financial, Inc. is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10104.

STOCK OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

    In general, &#39;beneficial ownership&#39; includes those shares a director or
executive officer has the power to vote or transfer, and stock options that are
exercisable currently or within 60 days. On December 31, 2000, the directors and
executive officers of Honeywell beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 2,968,499
shares of common stock which are included in the table below. Directors and
executive officers also have interests in stock-based units under Honeywell&#39;s
plans. While these units

                                       61





&lt;PAGE&gt;
may not be voted or transferred, we have included them in the table below as

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

    In connection with certain tax planning, we secured supplemental retirement
payments for three executives by funding them through an escrow arrangement.
The amounts funded through an escrow arrangement in 2000 were $4,000,000 for
Mr. Bonsignore, $2,100,000 for Mr. Wallman, and $1,400,000 for Dr. Barry C.
Johnson. By securing the payments, the executive&#39;s tax liability was
accelerated. We loaned each executive an amount equal to the related
withholding tax obligation. We will also loan each executive additional amounts
as necessary to cover the balance of taxes related to securing the payments.

    The loans bear interest at 5.53 percent compounded semiannually and are due
December 31, 2004. On December 31, 2000, the amount of loans outstanding totaled
$2,977,590, of which $1,635,200 was loaned to Mr. Bonsignore, $765,450 to
Mr. Wallman and $576,940 to Dr. Johnson.

         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-QUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN FOR HIGHLY COMPENSATED
         EMPLOYEES OF HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
                           (Career Band 6 and above)
                (As Amended and Restated as of December 1, 2000)


1. Eligibility

         Those highly compensated employees (&#34;HCEs&#34;) of Honeywell International
Inc. (the &#34;Corporation&#34;) and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section
414(q) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#34;Code&#34;) in Career Band 6 and
above who are eligible to participate in any of the qualified (as determined
under Code Section 401(a)) savings plans maintained by the Corporation or its
subsidiaries, other than any such plan maintained by Honeywell Inc. prior to
April 1, 2000, (the &#34;Qualified Savings Plans&#34;) are eligible to participate in
the Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees of
Honeywell International Inc. and its Subsidiaries (Career Band 6 and above) (the
&#34;Plan&#34;).

2. Definitions

         Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the Plan have the respective
meanings set forth in the applicable Qualified Savings Plans.

3. Participation

         (a) Time and Form of Election. Any eligible employee may become a
participant in the Plan (a &#34;Participant&#34;) as of the beginning of the next
available pay period, by executing a written or electronic notice of election to
participate and filing such notice with the Plan Administrator (as defined in
Section 10(a)) prior to the beginning of such pay period. Such notice may direct
that a portion (determined in accordance with paragraph 4(a)) of the base annual
salary exclusive of shift differentials, overtime or other premium pay, bonus,
incentive or other extra compensation, but inclusive of severance pay (unless
otherwise specifically excluded by the severance pay plan) or salary deferred
under this Plan or otherwise (&#34;Base Annual Salary&#34;), which would have been
payable to such Participant during such pay period and succeeding pay periods,
in lieu of such payment, be credited to a deferred compensation account
maintained under the Plan as an unfunded book entry stated as a cash balance
(the &#34;Participant&#39;s Account&#34;). Amounts so credited to the Participant&#39;s Account
shall constitute &#34;Participant Deferred Contributions.&#34; A Participant&#39;s election
to direct that a portion of his or her Base Annual Salary be credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account shall continue in effect until the Participant terminates
such election, the Participant is no longer an HCE or the Participant is no
longer eligible to contribute to the Qualified Savings Plans. Any such
termination shall be effective only with respect to the Participant&#39;s Base
Annual Salary payable after the end of the pay period in which one of the events
in the preceding sentence occurs. Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account
prior to the effective date of the termination of the election shall not be
affected and shall be distributed only in accordance with the terms of the Plan
and Participant&#39;s distribution election thereunder.





&lt;PAGE&gt;

         (b) Change or Resumption of Amount Deferred. A Participant may elect at
any time to modify the amount of Base Annual Salary to be credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account under the Plan, which modification shall be effective for
the next available pay period following his or her election. Amounts credited to
the Participant&#39;s Account prior to the effective date of such change shall not
be affected by such change and shall be distributed only in accordance with the
terms of the Plan.

4. Contributions to Participants&#39; Accounts

         (a) Participant Deferred Contributions. Unless the Plan Administrator
shall have established a lesser amount, a Participant may elect to defer an
aggregate amount equal to the difference between (i) a full percentage of such
Participant&#39;s Base Annual Salary from 1% to the maximum percentage permitted
under the Qualified Savings Plans and Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) for Before-Tax
Contributions by an individual who is not an HCE and who is eligible to
participate in the Qualified Savings Plans, without regard to any other
limitations which may apply under the Code and without regard to any After-Tax
Contributions which might be made under the Qualified Savings Plans, and (ii)
the full amount of Before-Tax Contributions made by such Participant under the
Qualified Savings Plans; provided, however, that a Participant who elects to
defer any amount hereunder shall be required to make the maximum Before-Tax
Contributions permissible under the Qualified Savings Plans for the applicable
Plan Year (after giving effect to deferrals under the Plan or otherwise).

         (b) Plan Employer Contributions. There shall be credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account employer contributions under the Plan (&#34;Plan Employer
Contributions&#34;) in an aggregate amount equal to (i) minus (ii), where (i) is
50% (for participants entitled to a 50% Employer Contribution in the Qualified
Savings Plans) or 100% (for participants entitled to a 100% Employer
Contribution in the Qualified Savings Plans) of the lesser of (x) 8% of the
Participant&#39;s Base Annual Salary, or (y) the sum of the Participant&#39;s
Participant Contributions under the Qualified Savings Plans and Participant
Deferred Contributions under the Plan, expressed as a percentage of Base
Annual Salary, and (ii) is the total amount of Employer Contributions made
with respect to the Participant under the Qualified Savings Plans; provided,
however, that in no event shall the combined Plan Employer Contributions and
Employer Contributions made with respect to the Participant exceed 8% of
the Participant&#39;s Base Annual Salary, and provided, further, that Plan Employer
Contributions shall not be made with respect to a Participant during any
period of suspension of Employer Contributions with respect to such Participant
under the terms of the Qualified Savings Plans, whether or not such
Participant continues to make Participant Contributions under the Qualified
Savings Plans during the period of such suspension. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, there shall be credited to the Participant&#39;s Account an
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of whole shares of common stock
of Honeywell International Inc. (&#34;Common Stock&#34;) credited to such Participant&#39;s
Account under Section 5(b) on December 29, 2000, and (ii) $0.08 (such product
rounded to the nearest full dollar). The amount determined under the preceding
sentence shall be credited to the Participant&#39;s Account as Plan Employer
Contributions in accordance with Section 5(a) and shall be credited to such
Account no later than December 31, 2000.

         (c) Vesting. Participant Deferred Contributions, Plan Employer
Contributions (collectively &#34;Total Contribution Amounts&#34;) and all amounts
accrued with respect to Total Contribution Amounts in accordance with Section 5,
shall be vested at the time such amounts are credited to the Participant&#39;s
Account.


                                      -2-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

         (d) All Contributions Prorated. Total Contribution Amounts shall be
credited to a Participant&#39;s Account each pay period.

5. The Participant&#39;s Account

         (a) Crediting of Participant&#39;s Accounts. Participant Deferred
Contributions shall be credited to the Participant&#39;s Account under the Plan as
unfunded book entries stated as cash balances. Participant Deferred
Contributions credited to the Participant&#39;s Account prior to January 1, 1994 or
after the Participant has terminated employment shall accrue amounts (to be
posted each Valuation Date) equivalent to interest, compounded daily, at a rate
based upon the cost to the Corporation of borrowing at a fixed rate for a
15-year term. Such rate shall be determined annually by the Chief Financial
Officer of the Corporation in consultation with the Treasurer of the
Corporation. Participant Deferred Contributions credited to the Participant&#39;s
Account on or after January 1, 1994, but before a Participant terminates
employment, shall accrue amounts (to be posted each Valuation Date) equivalent
to interest, compounded daily, at a rate determined annually by the Management
Development and Compensation Committee (the &#34;Committee&#34;) of the Board of
Directors (the &#34;Board&#34;) of the Corporation. The rate established in the
preceding sentence shall not exceed the greater of (i) 10%, or (ii) 200% of the
10-year U.S. Treasury Bond rate at the time of determination and, once
established for a calendar year, shall remain in effect with respect to all
Participant Deferred Contributions credited to the Participant&#39;s Account during
such calendar year until such amounts are distributed. Plan Employer
Contributions shall be credited to the Participant&#39;s Account under the Plan as
unfunded book entries stated as shares of Common Stock (including fractional
shares). The number of shares of Common Stock credited to a Participant&#39;s
Account shall be determined by dividing the equivalent cash amount (as
determined under Section 4(b)) by the closing price of Common Stock on the day
that such Plan Employer Contributions are credited to the Participant&#39;s Account.
Amounts equivalent to the dividends that would have been payable in respect of
the Common Stock shall be credited to the Participant&#39;s Account as if reinvested
in Common Stock, with the number of shares credited determined by dividing the
equivalent cash dividend amount by the closing price of Common Stock on the date
the dividends would have been payable. Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s
Account shall accrue amounts equivalent to interest and dividends, as the case
may be, until distributed in accordance with the Plan.

         (b) Transition Rule for Plan Employer Contributions. The balance of
each Participant&#39;s Account attributable to Plan Employer Contributions,
determined as of the close of business on the day prior to the effective date of
the amendment and restatement of the Plan and adjusted to reflect all gains,
losses and dividends that have been credited to such Participant&#39;s Account
through the day prior to such effective date, shall be converted into the
equivalent number of shares of Common Stock by dividing such balance by the
closing price of Common Stock on the trading date next preceding such effective
date. Such amount shall be an unfunded book entry only and shall (i) thereafter
be credited with equivalent dividend amounts in accordance with Section 5(a),
and (ii) be distributed in accordance with Section 6(a)(ii).

6. Distribution from Accounts

         (a) Form of Election.

         (i) Participant Deferred Contributions. At the time a Participant makes
an election pursuant to Section 3(a), the Participant shall also make an
election with respect to the


                                      -3-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

distribution of the aggregate amount of the Participant Deferred Contributions,
plus earnings credited thereon pursuant to Section 5 (collectively the
&#34;Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts&#34;), credited to the Participant&#39;s
Account pursuant to such election. A Participant may elect to receive such
amount in one lump-sum payment or in a number of annual installments (up to
fifteen installments). The lump-sum payment or the first installment shall be
paid in cash as soon as practicable during the month of January of such future
calendar year as the Participant may designate or, if the Participant so elects,
as soon as practicable during the month of January of the calendar year
immediately following the later of the year in which the Participant last
contributed to the Plan or the year in which the Participant terminates
employment with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (whether by reason of
Retirement or otherwise). Except as otherwise provided in Section 8, subsequent
installments shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable during the month of
January of each succeeding calendar year until the entire amount of the
Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts shall have been paid. The amount of
each installment shall be determined by multiplying the balance of the
Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts each year by a fraction, the numerator
of which is one and the denominator of which is (A) the number of installments
elected, reduced by (B) one for each annual installment previously received.

         (ii) Plan Employer Contributions. The distribution election made
pursuant to subsection (i) above shall also apply to the timing of the
distribution of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock representing the
Plan Employer Contributions plus reinvested dividends pursuant to Section 5
(collectively the &#34;Plan Employer Contribution Amounts&#34;) credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account pursuant to Section 5. Except to the extent otherwise
provided with respect to fractional shares, all distributions of Plan Employer
Contribution Amounts shall be made in Common Stock. A Participant may elect to
receive such Plan Employer Contribution Amounts in one lump-sum payment or in a
number of annual installments (up to fifteen installments). The lump-sum payment
or the first installment shall be paid as soon as practicable during the month
of January of such future calendar year as the Participant may designate, or, if
the Participant so elects, as soon as practicable during the month of January of
the calendar year immediately following the later of the year in which the
Participant last contributed to the Plan or the year in which the Participant
terminates employment with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (whether
by reason of Retirement or otherwise). Except as otherwise provided in Section
8, subsequent installments shall be paid as soon as practicable during the month
of January of each succeeding calendar year until the entire amount of the Plan
Employer Contribution Amounts shall have been paid. The amount of each
installment shall be determined by (A) multiplying the balance of the Plan
Employer Contribution Amounts on the last Valuation Date of each year by a
fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is (x) the
number of installments elected, reduced by (y) one for each annual installment
previously received, and (B) rounding the result down to the next whole share of
Common Stock; provided, however, the amount of the last installment shall be
determined without regard to the rounding requirement of the preceding portion
of this sentence. Any fractional shares of Common Stock shall be paid in an
equivalent cash amount, as determined using the closing price of Common Stock on
the trading date next preceding the distribution date.

         (b) Adjustment of Method of Distribution. Prior to the beginning of any
calendar year, a Participant may elect to change the timing and method of
distribution of the Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts and Plan Employer
Contribution Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account commencing with such
calendar year. Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts and Plan Employer
Contribution Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account prior to the
effective date of such change (the &#34;Prior Balance&#34;), and all amounts thereafter
accrued with


                                      -4-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

respect to the Prior Balance, shall not be affected by such change and, except
as otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator pursuant to Section 8, shall
be distributed only in accordance with the election in effect at the time such
Prior Balance was credited to the Participant&#39;s Account.

         (c)(i) Distribution Default for Participant Deferred Contribution
Amounts. Any Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts credited to a
Participant&#39;s Account which are not covered by a timely distribution election
under subsections (a) and (b) above shall be distributed to the Participant in
one lump-sum cash payment as soon as practicable during the month of January of
the calendar year immediately following the later of the year in which the
Participant last contributed to the Plan or the year in which the Participant
terminates his employment with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
(whether by reason of Retirement or otherwise); provided, however, if the
Participant has made an election pursuant to Sections 9(a)(i) or 9(a)(ii), the
lump sum payment shall be made within the 90-day period following a Change in
Control, as defined in Section 9(c).

         (c)(ii) Distribution Default for Plan Employer Contribution Amounts.
Any Plan Employer Contribution Amounts credited to a Participant&#39;s Account which
are not covered by a timely distribution election under subsections (a) and (b)
above shall be distributed to the Participant in Common Stock as soon as
practicable during the month of January of the calendar year immediately
following the later of the year in which the Participant last contributed to the
Plan or the year in which the Participant terminates his employment with the
Corporation or any of it subsidiaries (whether by reason of Retirement or
otherwise); provided, however, if the Participant has made an election pursuant
to Sections 9(a)(i) or (ii), the distribution shall be made within the 90-day
period following a Change in Control, as defined in Section 9(c). Any fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be paid in an equivalent cash amount, as determined
using the closing price of Common Stock on the trading date next preceding the
distribution date.

         (d) One-Time Election. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to
the contrary, a Participant shall be given a one-time opportunity prior to
January 1, 2001 to make a new election with respect to the distribution of his
Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts, including a new election with respect
to the Participant&#39;s Prior Balance attributable to such Participant Deferred
Contribution Amounts (other than the portion of such Prior Balance payable, or
part of a series of payments payable, in January 2001), provided, however, that
any such election shall only be authorized by the Committee if it results in a
further deferral of the distribution of the Participant Deferred Contribution
Amounts or Prior Balance attributable to such Participant Deferred Contribution
Amounts from that previously elected. Such election shall be effective upon a
&#34;Merger&#34; of the Corporation and General Electric Company (as defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger between Honeywell International Inc. and General
Electric Company dated October 22, 2000) and acceptance of the election by the
Corporation. Any such election shall be subject to such restrictions and
limitations as the Corporation shall determine in its sole discretion.


                                      -5-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

7. Distribution on Death

         (a) Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts. If a Participant should
die before all Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account have been paid in accordance with the election referred to
in Sections 6(a) or 6(b), the balance of the Participant Deferred Contribution
Amounts in such Participant&#39;s Account shall be paid in cash as soon as
practicable following the Participant&#39;s death to the beneficiary designated in
writing by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator; provided,
however, if the Participant has made an election pursuant to Sections 9(a)(i) or
9(a)(ii), such amount shall be paid within the 90-day period following a Change
in Control, as defined in Section 9(c). If (i) no beneficiary designation has
been made, or (ii) the designated beneficiary shall have predeceased the
Participant and no further designation has been made, then such balance shall be
paid to the estate of the Participant. A Participant may change the designated
beneficiary at any time during the Participant&#39;s lifetime by filing a subsequent
designation in writing with the Plan Administrator.

         (b) Plan Employer Contribution Amounts. If a Participant should die
before all Plan Employer Contribution Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s
Account have been paid in accordance with the election referred to in Sections
6(a) or 6(b), the balance of the Plan Employer Contribution Amounts in such
Participant&#39;s Account shall be paid in Common Stock as soon as practicable
following the Participant&#39;s death to the beneficiary designated in writing by
the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator; provided, however, if the
Participant has made an election pursuant to Sections 9(a)(i) or 9(a)(ii), such
amount shall be paid within the 90-day period following a Change in Control, as
defined in Section 9(c). If (i) no such beneficiary designation has been made,
or (ii) the designated beneficiary shall have predeceased the Participant and no
further designation has been made, then such balance shall be paid to the estate
of the Participant. A Participant may change the designated beneficiary at any
time during the Participant&#39;s lifetime by filing a subsequent designation in
writing with the Plan Administrator. Any fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be paid in an equivalent cash amount, as determined using the closing price of
Common Stock on the trading date next preceding the distribution date.

8. Payment in the Event of Hardship

         Upon receipt of a request from a Participant, delivered in writing to
the Plan Administrator along with a Certificate of Unavailability of Resources
form, the Plan Administrator, or his designee, may cause the Corporation to
accelerate (or require the subsidiary of the Corporation which employs or
employed the Participant to accelerate) payment of all or any part of the amount
credited to the Participant&#39;s Account, including accrued amounts, if it finds in
its sole discretion that payment of such amounts in accordance with the
Participant&#39;s prior election under Sections 6(a) or 6(b) would result in severe
financial hardship to the Participant, and such hardship is the result of an
unforeseeable emergency caused by circumstances beyond the control of the
Participant. Acceleration of payment may not be made under this Section 8 to the
extent that such hardship is or may be relieved (a) through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise, (b) by liquidation of the Participant&#39;s
assets, to the extent the liquidation of assets would not itself cause severe
financial hardship, or (c) by cessation of deferrals under this Plan or any
tax-qualified savings plan of the Corporation or its subsidiaries. Any
distribution of Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts pursuant to this
Section 8 shall be made in cash, while any distribution of Plan Employer
Contribution Amounts pursuant to this Section 8 shall be made in Common Stock.
Any fractional shares of


                                      -6-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

Common Stock shall be paid in an equivalent cash amount, as determined using the
closing price of Common Stock on the trading date next preceding the
distribution date.

9. Change in Control

         (a)(i) Initial Lump-Sum Payment Election. Notwithstanding any election
made pursuant to Section 6, any person who becomes eligible to participate in
the Plan may file a written election with the Plan Administrator at the time the
individual makes an election to participate pursuant to Section 3(a) to have the
aggregate amount credited to the Participant&#39;s Account (commencing with the date
on which such written election is filed) paid in one-lump sum payment as soon as
practicable following a Change in Control, but in no event later than 90 days
after such Change in Control. Any distribution of Participant Deferred
Contribution Amounts pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made in cash, while any
distribution of Plan Employer Contribution Amounts pursuant to this Section 9
shall be made in Common Stock (or the common stock of any successor corporation
issued in exchange for, or with respect to, Common Stock incident to the Change
in Control). Any fractional shares of Common Stock (or the common stock of any
successor corporation issued in exchange for, or with respect to, Common Stock
incident to the Change in Control) shall be paid in an equivalent cash amount.

         (a)(ii) Subsequent Lump-Sum Payment Election. A Participant who did not
make an election pursuant to Section 9(a)(i) or who has revoked, pursuant to
Section 9(a)(iii), an election previously made under Section 9(a)(i) or this
Section 9(a)(ii) may, prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or the
beginning of the calendar year in which the election is to take effect, elect to
have the aggregate amount credited to the Participant&#39;s Account for all calendar
years commencing with the first calendar year beginning after the date the
election is made, paid in one lump-sum payment as soon as practicable following
a Change in Control, but in no event later than 90 days after such Change in
Control. Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account prior to the effective
date of the election made pursuant to this Section 9(a)(ii) shall not be
affected by such election and shall be distributed following a Change in Control
in accordance with any prior election in effect under Sections 9(a)(i) or
9(a)(ii).

         (a)(iii) Revocation of Lump-Sum Payment Elections. A Participant may,
prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or the beginning of any calendar
year, file an election revoking any election made pursuant to Sections 9(a)(i)
or 9(a)(ii), with respect to amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account
commencing with the first calendar year beginning after the election is made.
Amounts credited to the Participant&#39;s Account prior to the effective date of the
election made pursuant to this Section 9(a)(iii) shall not be affected by such
election and shall be distributed following a Change in Control in accordance
with any prior election in effect under Sections 9(a)(i) or 9(a)(ii).
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph 9, a Participant
shall be given a one-time opportunity prior to January 1, 2001 to revoke any
election made pursuant to paragraph 9(a)(i) or 9(a)(ii) to receive a lump sum
payment of Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts as soon as practicable
following a Change in Control. Any such revocation shall be applicable to the
Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts, including the Participant&#39;s Prior
Balance attributable to Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts. Any
revocation election shall be effective upon a &#34;Merger&#34; of the Corporation and
General Electric Company (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger between
Honeywell International Inc. and General Electric Company dated October 22,
2000) and acceptance by the Corporation. Any such election shall be subject to
such restrictions and limitations as the Corporation shall determine in its sole
discretion.

&lt;PAGE&gt;

         (b) Interest Equivalents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Plan, after a Change in Control, the Plan may not provide, or be amended to
provide, interest accruals with respect to Participant Deferred Contributions at
rates lower than the rates in effect under Section 5 immediately prior to the
Change in Control.

         (c) Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of the Plan, a Change
in Control is deemed to occur at the time (i) when any entity, person or group

10. Administration

         (a) Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator and &#34;named fiduciary&#34;
for purposes of ERISA shall be the Senior Vice President-Human Resources and
Communications of the Corporation (or the person acting in such capacity in the
event such position is abolished, restructured or renamed). The Plan
Administrator shall have the authority to appoint one or more other named
fiduciaries of the Plan and to designate persons, other than named fiduciaries,
to carry out fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan, pursuant to Section
405(c)(1)(B) of ERISA. Any person acting on behalf of the Plan Administrator
shall serve without additional compensation. The Plan Administrator shall keep
or cause to be kept such records and shall prepare or cause to be prepared such
returns or reports as may be required by law or necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan.

         (b) Powers and Duties of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator
shall have the full discretionary power and authority to construe and interpret
the Plan (including, without limitation, supplying omissions from, correcting
deficiencies in, or resolving inconsistencies or ambiguities in, the language of
the Plan); to determine all questions of fact arising under the Plan, including
questions as to eligibility for and the amount of benefits; to establish such
rules and regulations (consistent with the terms of the Plan) as it deems
necessary or appropriate for administration of the Plan; to delegate
responsibilities to others to assist it in administering the Plan; to retain
attorneys, consultants, accountants or other persons (who may be employees of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries) to render advice and assistance as it
shall determine to be necessary to effect the proper discharge of any duty for
which it is responsible; and to perform all other acts it believes reasonable
and proper in connection with the administration of the Plan. The Plan
Administrator shall be entitled to rely on the records of the Corporation and
its subsidiaries in determining any Participant&#39;s entitlement to and the amount
of benefits payable


                                      -8-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

under the Plan. Any determination of the Plan Administrator, including
interpretations of the Plan and determinations of questions of fact, shall be
final and binding on all parties.

         (c) Indemnification. To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation
shall indemnify the Plan Administrator from all claims for liability, loss, or
damage (including payment of expenses in connection with defense against such
claims) arising from any act or failure to act in connection with the Plan.


11. Claims Procedures and Appeals

         (a) Any request or claim for Plan benefits must be made in writing and
shall be deemed to be filed by a Participant when a written request is made by
the claimant or the claimant&#39;s authorized representative which is reasonably
calculated to bring the claim to the attention of the Plan Administrator.

         (b) The Plan Administrator shall provide notice in writing to any
Participant when a claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied in whole or
in part. Such notice shall be provided within 90 days of the receipt by the Plan
Administrator of the Participant&#39;s claim or, if special circumstances require,
and the Participant is so notified in writing, within 180 days of the receipt by
the Plan Administrator of the Participant&#39;s claim. The notice shall be written
in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall:

             (i) set forth the specific reasons for the denial of benefits;

            (ii) contain specific references to Plan provisions relative to the
denial;

           (iii) describe any material and information, if any, necessary for
the claim for benefits to be allowed, that had been requested, but not received
by the Plan Administrator; and

            (iv) advise the Participant that any appeal of the Plan
Administrator&#39;s adverse determination must be made in writing to the Plan
Administrator within 60 days after receipt of the initial denial notification,
and must set forth the facts upon which the appeal is based.

         (c) If notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished within the time
periods set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied and the claimant shall
be permitted to proceed to the review procedures set forth below. If the
Participant fails to appeal the Plan Administrator&#39;s denial of benefits in
writing and within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of written notification
of denial of the claim (or within 60 days after a deemed denial of the claim),
the Plan Administrator&#39;s determination shall become final and conclusive.

         (d) If the Participant appeals the Plan Administrator&#39;s denial of
benefits in a timely fashion, the Plan Administrator shall re-examine all issues
relevant to the original denial of benefits. Any such claimant, or his or her
duly authorized representative, may review any pertinent documents, as
determined by the Plan Administrator, and submit in writing any issues or
comments to be addressed on appeal.

         (e) The Plan Administrator shall advise the Participant and such
individual&#39;s representative of its decision, which shall be written in a manner
calculated to be understood by the claimant, and include specific references to
the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Such response
shall be made within 60 days of receipt of the written appeal,


                                      -9-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

unless special circumstances require an extension of such 60-day period for not
more than an additional 60 days. Where such extension is necessary, the claimant
shall be given written notice of the delay. If the decision on review is not
furnished within the time set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied on
review.

         (f) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to
any Plan benefit, including, without limitation, any dispute, controversy or
claim as to whether the decision of the Plan Administrator respecting the
benefits under this Plan or interpretation of this Plan is arbitrary and
capricious, that is not settled in accordance with the procedures outlined in
this Section 11, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance
with the American Arbitration Association Employment Dispute Resolution or other
applicable Rules. Before resorting to arbitration, an aggrieved Participant must
first follow the review procedure outlined in this Section of the Plan. If there
is still a dispute after the procedures in this Section have been exhausted, the
Participant must request arbitration in writing within six (6) months after the
Plan Administrator issues, or is deemed to have issued, its determination under
subparagraph (e) above.

                  The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the
parties, if possible. If the parties fail to reach agreement upon appointment of
an arbitrator within 30 days following receipt by one party of the other party&#39;s
notice of desire to arbitrate, the arbitrator shall be selected from a panel or
panels of persons submitted by the American Arbitration Association (the &#34;AAA&#34;).
The selection process shall be that which is set forth in the AAA Employment
Dispute Resolution Rules, except that, if the parties fail to select an
arbitrator from one or more panels, AAA shall not have the power to make an
appointment but shall continue to submit additional panels until an arbitrator
has been selected.

                  All fees and expenses of the arbitration, including a
transcript if requested, will be borne by the Corporation. The arbitrator shall
have no power to amend, add to or subtract from this Plan. The award shall be
admissible in any court or agency action seeking to enforce or render
unenforceable this Plan or any portion thereof. Any action to enforce or vacate
the arbitrator&#39;s award shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act if
applicable.

12. Miscellaneous

         (a) Anti-Alienation. The right of a Participant to receive any amount
credited to the Participant&#39;s Account shall not be transferable or assignable by
the Participant, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. To
the extent that any person acquires a right to receive any amount credited to a
Participant&#39;s Account hereunder, such right shall be no greater than that of an
unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. Except as expressly provided
herein, any person having an interest in any amount credited to a Participant&#39;s
Account under the Plan shall not be entitled to payment until the date the
amount is due and payable. No person shall be entitled to anticipate any payment
by assignment, pledge or transfer in any form or manner prior to actual or
constructive receipt thereof.

         (b) Unsecured General Creditor. Neither the Corporation nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to reserve or otherwise set aside funds, Common
Stock or other assets for the payment of its obligations hereunder. However, the
Corporation or any subsidiary may, in its sole discretion, establish funds for
payment of its obligations hereunder. Any such funds shall remain assets of the
Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, and subject to the claims of
its general creditors. Such funds, if any, shall not be deemed to be assets of
the Plan.


                                      -10-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

The Plan is intended to be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

         (c) Withholding. The Corporation shall withhold from any distribution
made from Participant Deferred Contribution Amounts the amount necessary to
satisfy applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. With
respect to distributions of Plan Employer Contribution Amounts, the delivery of
the shares of Common Stock shall be delayed until the Participant makes
arrangements, pursuant to procedures to be adopted by the Plan Administrator, to
satisfy the applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.

         (d) Termination and Amendment. The Corporation may at any time amend or
terminate the Plan. No amendment or termination shall impair the rights of a
Participant with respect to amounts then credited to the Participant&#39;s Account.

         (e) Benefit Statements. Each Participant will receive periodic
statements (not less frequently than annually) regarding the Participant&#39;s
Account. Each such statement shall indicate the amount of the balances credited
to the Participant&#39;s Account as of the end of the period covered by such
statement.

         (f) Legal Interpretation. This Plan and its provisions shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent
such Delaware law is not inconsistent with the provisions of ERISA. The text of
this Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, govern the determination of the
rights and obligations created or referred to herein. Headings to the Sections,
paragraphs and subparagraphs are for reference purposes only and do not limit or
extend the meaning of any of the Plan&#39;s provisions.

         (g) Employment. The adoption and maintenance of this Plan shall not be
deemed to constitute a contract between the Corporation or its subsidiaries and
any employee or to be a consideration for or condition of employment of any
person. No provision of the Plan shall be deemed to give any employee the right
to continue in the employ of the Corporation or its subsidiaries or to interfere
with the right of the Corporation or its subsidiaries to discharge any employee
at any time without regard to the effect which such discharge might have upon
the employee&#39;s participation in the Plan or benefits under it.

         (h) Fiduciary Capacities. Any person or group of persons may serve in
more than one fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan. For purposes of this
Section 12(h), the term &#34;fiduciary&#34; shall have the same meaning as in ERISA.

         (i) Participants Subject to Section 16. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any request, election or other action under the Plan
affecting a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 should require the approval of the Committee to exempt such request,
election or other action from potential liability under Section 16, then the
approval of the Committee shall be obtained in lieu of the approval of the Plan
Administrator.

                  (i)   Pay Continuation.

                        (A) An Existing Participant shall receive a benefit in
                            an amount equal to his or her Base Salary multiplied
                            by the relevant Severance Pay Factor determined as
                            follows (a detailed schedule of each Existing
                            Participant&#39;s Severance Pay Factor is attached
                            hereto as Exhibit A):

&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;CAPTION&gt;
                                    Salary Grade as of July 1, 1993       Severance Pay Factor
                                    -------------------------------       --------------------
                                     &lt;S&gt;                                   &lt;C&gt;
                                          20 and 21                                  18
                                          22 and 23                                  24
                                          24 and above                               36
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

                            Provided, however, that the Severance Pay Factor of
                            an Existing Participant, whose Salary Grade is
                            reduced after a Change in Control, shall not be
                            reduced.

                        (B) An Officer Participant shall receive a benefit in an
                            amount equal to his or her Base Salary multiplied by
                            a Severance Pay Factor of 18.

                        (C) A New Participant shall receive a benefit in an
                            amount equal to his or her Base Salary multiplied by
                            a Severance Pay Factor of 12.

                  (ii)  Annual Incentive Compensation. An Existing Participant
                        or an Officer Participant shall receive a benefit in an
                        amount equal to his or her Annual Incentive Compensation
                        multiplied by the applicable Pro Rata Factor. The Pro
                        Rata Factor shall be determined for the calendar year in
                        which a Covered Termination occurs and each calendar
                        year thereafter through the end of the calendar year in
                        which the Severance Period ends.

                  (iii) Benefit Continuation. For the duration of the Severance
                        Period, the Employer will continue the Participant&#39;s
                        employee benefits including, without limitation,
                        continuation of the Participant&#39;s savings plan
                        participation (to the extent permissible under Section
                        401(a) of the Code) and basic and contributory life and
                        medical insurance (including qualified dependents), at
                        the active employee coverage level and prevailing
                        employee contribution rate, if any; provided, however,
                        (A) that such level of continued benefits shall not
                        exceed the level of benefits in effect on the date of
                        the Participant&#39;s Covered Termination, (B) that such
                        continuation of benefits will cease on the date similar
                        benefits are provided the Participant by a subsequent
                        employer, (C) executive perquisites, such as


                                      -5-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                        automobiles or memberships, will be governed by the
                        terms of the particular programs, and (D) that no
                        employee benefit shall be continued for a longer period
                        of time than that provided by the terms of the
                        controlling employee benefit plan applicable to the
                        Participant on the date of such Participant&#39;s Covered
                        Termination.

                  (iv)  Pension Service Continuation. Except as otherwise
                        provided by an applicable pension plan and, subject to
                        the requirements for qualification of Section 401(a) of
                        the Code, only the first twelve (12) months of the
                        Severance Period, Pay Continuation and Prorated Annual
                        Incentive Compensation will be recognized for purposes
                        of the vesting and pension calculation provisions of the
                        AlliedSignal Inc. Retirement Program or any other
                        pension plan sponsored by an Employer in which the
                        Participant participates. The normal policy for
                        qualifying leaves remains applicable thereafter.

         (b)      Benefits Conditioned on Release. Notwithstanding anything in
                  this Section 3 to the contrary, all benefits under this Plan
                  except benefits provided pursuant to Part II, shall be
                  provided in consideration for, and conditioned upon, execution
                  of the release by the Participant of all current or future
                  claims, known or unknown, arising on or before the date of the
                  release against the Employer, its affiliates or their
                  respective officers substantially in the form attached hereto
                  as Exhibit B. Additionally, no severance benefits shall be
                  payable under this Section 3 unless the Participant has
                  returned to the Employer all property of the Employer and any
                  information of a proprietary nature in his or her possession.

         (c)      Benefit Limitations.

                  (i)   Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) below, any
                        benefit determined to be payable to a Participant under
                        any other severance plan sponsored or funded by an
                        Employer shall be reduced by the amount of any similar
                        benefit payable to the Participant under this Plan
                        (excluding any benefit payable under Section 19(a))
                        regardless of whether the benefit determined under the
                        Plan is payable at an earlier or a later date than
                        payments under such other severance plan.

                  (ii)  Any benefit determined to be payable under this Plan
                        (excluding any benefit payable under Section 19(a)) to a
                        Participant who was not eligible to participate in this
                        Plan prior to April 25, 1988 will be reduced to the
                        extent of any duplication of benefits between the Plan
                        and any benefits that may be payable to the Participant
                        under arrangements existing prior to April 25, 1988.

4.       Form and Timing of Payment.

         shall be paid in equal monthly installments during the Severance
         Period, and any Prorated Annual Incentive Compensation shall be paid
         annually as soon after the end of the Determination Year as is
         practicable. No Prorated Annual Incentive Compensation shall be payable
         for any Determination Year with respect to which the Pro Rata Factor is
         less than or equal to zero.

5.       Forfeiture of Benefits.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan and except as
         provided in Section 20(c), a Participant receiving benefits or
         otherwise entitled to receive benefits under this Plan shall cease to
         receive such benefits under the Plan and the right to receive any
         benefits in the future under the Plan shall be forfeited, in the event
         the Participant, either before or after termination of employment, as
         determined by the Named Fiduciary, in its sole discretion (a) is
         convicted of a felony, (b) commits any fraud or misappropriates
         property, proprietary information, intellectual property or trade
         secrets of the Employer for personal gain or for the benefit of another
         party, (c) actively recruits and offers employment to any management
         employee of the Employer, or (d) engages in intentional misconduct
         substantially damaging to the property or business of any Employer, or
         (e) makes false or misleading statements about the Employer or its
         products, officers or employees to competitors or customers or
         potential customers of the Employer, or to current of former employees
         of the Employer.

6.       Payment of Benefits Upon Incompetence or Death.

         In the event the Named Fiduciary is presented with evidence
         satisfactory to it that a Participant receiving benefits or entitled to
         receive benefits is adjudged to be legally incompetent, the remainder
         of such Participant&#39;s unpaid benefits shall be paid to the
         Participant&#39;s conservator, legal representative or any other person
         deemed by the Named Fiduciary to have assumed responsibility for the
         maintenance of such person receiving or entitled to receive benefits.
         In the event a Participant receiving benefits or entitled to receive
         benefits dies, the remainder of such Participant&#39;s unpaid benefits
         shall be paid to the Participant&#39;s designated beneficiary. A
         Participant may designate a beneficiary in the form and manner
         prescribed by the Named Fiduciary. Any designation of a beneficiary may
         be revoked by filing a later designation or revocation. In the absence
         of an effective designation of a beneficiary by a Participant or upon
         the death of all beneficiaries on or before a Participant&#39;s death, the
         remainder of the Participant&#39;s unpaid benefits shall be paid to the
         Participant&#39;s spouse or, if none, to the Participant&#39;s estate. Any
         payment made pursuant to this Section 6 shall be a discharge of any
         liability under the Plan therefor.

7.       Administration.

         (a)      Plan Administration. Except as provided in Section 21(a), the
                  Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, who may
                  act through one or more Named Fiduciaries under this Plan who
                  shall have the powers and authorities as described in this
                  Section 7. The Plan Administrator shall be the Senior Vice
                  President,


                                      -7-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  Human Resources and Communications, or such other person as
                  the Board may appoint. The Plan Administrator shall have the
                  authority to appoint and remove any other Named Fiduciary at
                  his or her discretion.

                  Any person acting on behalf of the Named Fiduciary shall serve
                  without additional compensation. The Named Fiduciary shall
                  keep or cause to be kept such records and shall prepare or
                  cause to be prepared such returns or reports as may be
                  required by law or necessary for the proper administration of
                  the Plan.

         (b)      Powers and Duties of Named Fiduciary. The Named Fiduciary
                  shall have the full discretionary power and authority to
                  construe and interpret the Plan (including, without
                  limitation, supplying omissions from, correcting deficiencies
                  in, or resolving inconsistencies or ambiguities in, the
                  language of the Plan); to determine all questions of fact
                  arising under the Plan, including questions as to eligibility
                  for and the amount of benefits; to establish such rules and
                  regulations (consistent with the terms of the Plan) as it
                  deems necessary or appropriate for administration of the Plan;
                  to delegate responsibilities to others to assist it in
                  administering the Plan; and to perform all other acts it
                  believes reasonable and proper in connection with the
                  administration of the Plan. The Named Fiduciary shall be
                  entitled to rely on the records of the Employer in determining
                  any Participant&#39;s entitlement to and the amount of benefits
                  payable under the Plan. Any determination of the Named
                  Fiduciary, including interpretations of the Plan and
                  determinations of questions of fact, shall be final and
                  binding on all parties.

                  The Named Fiduciary may retain attorneys, consultants,
                  accountants or other persons (who may be employees of the
                  Employer) to render advice and assistance and may delegate any
                  of the authorities conferred on him under this Plan to such
                  persons as he shall determine to be necessary to effect the
                  discharge of his duties hereunder. The Plan Administrator, or
                  other Named Fiduciary, the Employer, the Company and its
                  officers and directors shall be entitled to rely upon the
                  advice, opinions and determinations of any such persons. Any
                  exercise of the authorities set forth in this Section 7,
                  whether by the Plan Administrator, or other Named Fiduciary or
                  his delegee, shall be final and binding upon the Employer and
                  all Participants.

         (c)      Plan Year.  The plan year shall be the calendar year.

         (d)      Indemnification. To the extent permitted by law, the Employer
                  shall indemnify any Named Fiduciary from all claims for
                  liability, loss, or damage (including payment of expenses in
                  connection with defense against such claims) arising from any
                  act or failure to act in connection with the Plan.

8.       Claims and Appeals Procedures.

         Except as provided in Sections 21(c)-(f), the Plan&#39;s benefit claims and
         appeals procedures shall be as follows:


                                      -8-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

         (a)      Any request or claim for Plan benefits must be made in writing
                  and shall be deemed to be filed by a Participant when a
                  written request is made by the claimant or the claimant&#39;s
                  authorized representative which is reasonably calculated to
                  bring the claim to the attention of the Named Fiduciary.

         (b)      The Named Fiduciary shall provide notice in writing to any
                  Participant when a claim for benefits under the Plan has been
                  denied in whole or in part. Such notice shall be provided
                  within 60 days of the receipt by the Named Fiduciary of the
                  Participant&#39;s claim or, if special circumstances require, and
                  the Participant is so notified in writing, within 120 days of
                  the receipt by the Named Fiduciary of the Participant&#39;s claim.
                  The notice shall be written in a manner calculated to be
                  understood by the claimant and shall:

                  (i)    set forth the specific reasons for the denial of
                         benefits;

                  (ii)   contain specific references to Plan provisions relative
                         to the denial;

                  (iii)  describe any material and information, if any,
                         necessary for the claim for benefits to be allowed,
                         that had been requested, but not received by the Named
                         Fiduciary; and

                  (iv)   advise the Participant that any appeal of the Named
                         Fiduciary&#39;s adverse determination must be made in
                         writing to the Named Fiduciary within 60 days after
                         receipt of the initial denial notification, and must
                         set forth the facts upon which the appeal is based.

         (c)      If notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished within the
                  time periods set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied
                  and the claimant shall be permitted to proceed to the review
                  procedures set forth below. If the Participant fails to appeal
                  the Named Fiduciary&#39;s denial of benefits in writing and within
                  60 days after receipt by the claimant of written notification
                  of denial of the claim (or within 60 days after a deemed
                  denial of the claim), the Named Fiduciary&#39;s determination
                  shall become final and conclusive.

         (d)      If the Participant appeals the Named Fiduciary&#39;s denial of
                  benefits in a timely fashion, the Plan Administrator shall
                  re-examine all issues relevant to the original denial of
                  benefits. Any such claimant, or his or her duly authorized
                  representative may review any pertinent documents, as
                  determined by the Plan Administrator, and submit in writing
                  any issues or comments to be addressed on appeal.

         (e)      The Plan Administrator shall advise the Participant and such
                  individual&#39;s representative of its decision which shall be
                  written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
                  claimant, and include specific references to the pertinent
                  Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Such response
                  shall be made within 60 days of receipt of the written appeal,
                  unless special circumstances require an


                                      -9-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  extension of such 60-day period for not more than an
                  additional 60 days. Where such extension is necessary, the
                  claimant shall be given written notice of the delay. Any
                  decision of the Plan Administrator shall be binding on all
                  persons affected thereby.

         (f)      Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating
                  to any Plan benefit, including, without limitation, any
                  dispute, controversy or claim as to whether the decision of
                  the Named Fiduciary respecting the benefits under this Plan or
                  interpretation of this Plan is arbitrary and capricious, that
                  is not settled in accordance with the procedures outlined in
                  Section 8, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration
                  in accordance with the American Arbitration Association
                  Employment Dispute Resolution or other applicable rules.
                  Before resorting to arbitration, an aggrieved Participant must
                  first follow the review procedure outlined in this Section of
                  the Plan. If there is still a dispute after the procedures in
                  this Section have been exhausted, the Participant must request
                  arbitration in writing within six (6) months after the issues,
                  or is deemed to have issued, its determination under
                  subparagraph (e) above.

                  The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the
                  parties, if possible. If the parties fail to reach agreement
                  upon appointment of an arbitrator within 30 days following
                  receipt by one party of the other party&#39;s notice of desire to
                  arbitrate, the arbitrator shall be selected from a panel or
                  panels of persons submitted by the American Arbitration
                  Association (the &#34;AAA&#34;). The selection process shall be that
                  which is set forth in the AAA Employment Dispute Resolution
                  Rules, except that, if the parties fail to select an
                  arbitrator from one or more panels, AAA shall not have the
                  power to make an appointment but shall continue to submit
                  additional panels until an arbitrator has been selected.

                  All fees and expenses of the arbitration, including a
                  transcript if requested, will be borne by the Company. The
                  arbitrator shall have no power to amend, add to or subtract
                  from this Plan. The award shall be admissible in any court or
                  agency seeking to enforce or render unenforceable this Plan or
                  any portion thereof. Any action to enforce or vacate the
                  arbitrator&#39;s award shall be governed by the Federal
                  Arbitration Act if applicable.

9.       Unfunded Obligation.

         All benefits payable under this Plan shall constitute an unfunded
         obligation of the Employer. Payments shall be made, as due, from the
         general funds of the Employer. This Plan shall constitute solely an
         unsecured promise by the Employer to pay severance benefits to
         employees to the extent provided herein.

10.      Inalienability of Benefits.

         No Participant shall have the power to transfer, assign, anticipate,
         mortgage or otherwise encumber any rights or any amounts payable under
         this Plan; nor shall any such rights or


                                      -10-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

         amounts payable under this Plan be subject to seizure, attachment,
         execution, garnishment or other legal or equitable process, or for the
         payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance, or
         be transferable by operation of law in the event of bankruptcy,
         insolvency, or otherwise. In the event a person who is receiving or is
         entitled to receive benefits under the Plan attempts to assign,
         transfer or dispose of such right, or if an attempt is made to subject
         such right to such process, such assignment, transfer or disposition
         shall be null and void.

11.      Withholding.

         The Employer shall have the right to withhold any taxes required to be
         withheld with respect to any payments due under this Plan.

12.      Amendment or Termination.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 21(i), the Company
         reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time without
         prior notice to or the consent of any employee. No amendment or
         termination shall adversely affect the rights of any Participant whose
         employment terminated prior to such amendment or termination. However,
         except as provided in Section 21(i), any Participant whose employment
         continues after amendment of the Plan shall be governed by the terms of
         the Plan as so amended. Any Participant whose employment continues
         after termination of the Plan shall have no right to a benefit under
         the Plan.

13.      Plan Not a Contract of Employment; Employer&#39;s Policies Control.

         Nothing contained in this Plan shall give an employee the right to be
         retained in the employment of an Employer. This Plan is not a contract
         of employment between the Employer and any employee.

         Any dispute involving issues of employment other than claims for
         benefits under this Plan shall be governed by the appropriate
         employment dispute resolution policies and procedures of the Employer.

14.      Action by an Employer.

         Unless expressly indicated to the contrary herein, any action required
         to be taken by the Company may be taken by action of its Board or by
         any appropriate officer or officers traditionally responsible for such
         determination or actions, or such other individual or individuals as
         may be designated by the Board or any such officer.

15.      Governing Law.

         The Plan is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
         Section 3(1) of ERISA, and will be construed in accordance with the
         provisions of ERISA.

                                      -11-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

16.      Severability.

         If any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any
         reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining
         parts of this Plan, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
         said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.

                  eligibility for benefits under the Plan or the amount of such

                  the purposes of this Plan, as they may affect Existing
                  Participants or Officer Participants, will not be adversely
                  affected by the unique circumstances which may exist following
                  a Change in Control. The provisions of this Part II will have

                  provision of the Code (hereafter the &#34;Section 4999 tax&#34;) or
                  the AlliedSignal Employer has withheld the amount of the
                  Section 4999 tax, an additional benefit (hereafter the
                  &#34;Enhancement Benefit&#34;) shall be paid from this Plan to such
                  affected Participant.

         (b)      The Enhancement Benefit payable shall be an amount, which when
                  added to all payments constituting &#34;parachute payments&#34; for
                  purposes of Section 280G or any successor or substitute
                  provision of the Code, is sufficient to cause the remainder of
                  (i) the sum of the &#34;parachute payments&#34;, including any
                  Enhancement Benefit, less (ii) the amount of all state, local
                  and federal income taxes and the Section 4999 tax attributable
                  to such payments and penalties and interest on any amount of
                  Section 4999 tax, other than penalties and interest on any
                  amount of Section 4999 tax with respect to which an
                  Enhancement Benefit was paid to the Participant on or before
                  the due date of the Participant&#39;s federal income tax return on
                  which such Section 4999 tax should have been paid, to be equal
                  to the remainder of (iii) sum of the &#34;parachute payments&#34;,
                  excluding any Enhancement Benefit, less (iv) the amount of all
                  state, local and federal income taxes attributable to such
                  payments determined as though the Section 4999 tax and
                  penalties and interest on any amount of Section 4999 tax,
                  other than penalties and interest on any amount of Section
                  4999 tax with respect to which an Enhancement Benefit was paid
                  to the Participant on or before the due date of the
                  Participant&#39;s federal income tax return on which such Section
                  4999 tax should have been paid, did not apply.

20.      Benefit Payments and Forfeitures.

         (a)      Benefit Payments. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4,
                  benefits that are determined to be payable to a Participant
                  under Sections 3(a)(i) and 3(a)(ii) on or after a Change in
                  Control shall be paid within thirty days following the later
                  of the Change in Control or the Covered Termination, in a
                  single payment equal to the sum of (i) the total amount of the
                  benefit remaining payable under Section 3(a)(i), and (ii) the
                  amount of the benefit remaining payable under Section 3(a)(ii)
                  for all Determination Years which are coextensive, in whole or
                  part, with the Severance Period. The requirements of Section
                  3(b) shall have no application to benefits payable after a
                  Change in Control. Benefits which are determined to be payable
                  to a Participant under Section 19(a) shall be paid within
                  thirty days following the later of a Change in Control or the
                  date the &#34;parachute payments&#34; referred to in Section 19 are
                  made, in a single payment equal to the amount of the benefit


                                      -16-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  determined under Section 19(b). If any benefit is paid later
                  than the time provided in this Section 20(a), such late
                  payment shall be credited with interest for the period from
                  the date payment should have been made to the date actually
                  made at a rate equal to the average quoted rate for
                  three-month U.S. Treasury Bills for the week preceding the
                  date of payment, as determined by the New Plan Administrator,
                  plus six percentage points.

         (b)      Subsequent Benefit Payments. Notwithstanding the provisions of
                  Section 4, in the event the Internal Revenue Service assesses
                  a Section 4999 tax due which is in excess of the amount
                  determined by the AlliedSignal Employer under Section 19(b), a
                  Participant shall be paid within thirty days following the
                  date the Participant gives notice to the New Plan
                  Administrator of proof of payment of the Section 4999 tax in a
                  single payment equal to the amount of the additional benefit
                  determined under Section 19(b), based upon the amount of the
                  Section 4999 tax paid in excess of any Section 4999 tax with
                  respect to which any Enhancement Benefit was previously paid.
                  If any benefit is paid later than the time provided in this
                  Section 20(b), such late payment shall be credited with
                  interest for the period from the date payment should have been
                  made to the date actually made at a rate equal to the average
                  quoted rate for three-month U.S. Treasury Bills for the week
                  preceding the date of payment, as determined by the New Plan
                  Administrator, plus six percentage points.

         (c)      Forfeiture of Benefits. Notwithstanding the provisions of
                  Section 5, a Participant receiving benefits or entitled to
                  receive benefits under the Plan shall cease to receive such
                  benefits under the Plan and the right to receive any benefits
                  in the future under the Plan shall be forfeited, in the event
                  the Participant, as determined by the New Plan Administrator,
                  (i) is convicted of a felony committed against an AlliedSignal
                  Employer, its property or business, (ii) commits any fraud or
                  misappropriates property, proprietary information,
                  intellectual property or trade secrets of an AlliedSignal
                  Employer for personal gain or for the benefit of another
                  party, or (iii) actively recruits and offers employment to any
                  management employee of an AlliedSignal Employer.

21.      Administration.

         (a)      New Plan Administrator. On or before a Change in Control, the
                  Company, its successors, or persons operating under its
                  control or on its behalf (hereafter the &#34;Corporation&#34;) shall
                  appoint a person independent of the Corporation to be the New
                  Plan Administrator upon the occurrence of a Change in Control
                  and the Plan Administrator shall immediately provide to the
                  New Plan Administrator such information with respect to each
                  Participant in the Plan as shall be necessary to enable the
                  New Plan Administrator to determine the amount of any benefit
                  which is then or may thereafter become payable to such
                  Participants.

         (b)      Authority. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the New
                  Plan Administrator shall have exclusive authority to make
                  initial determinations of eligibility for the benefits under
                  the Plan, subject to the requirements of Section 21(f). The
                  New Plan Administrator may, in reviewing any recommendation
                  for benefit eligibility pursuant to this Section 21, rely on
                  representations made by the Corporation or an AlliedSignal
                  Employer pursuant to Section 21(c). However, in the event that
                  none of the recommendations are agreed to by the Participant,
                  the New Plan Administrator shall refer the disputed claim for
                  benefits under this Plan for resolution as provided in Section
                  21(f). Any recommendation by the New Plan Administrator under
                  this Section 21, any determination by the New Plan
                  Administrator as to the eligibility for or the amount of
                  benefits which are not in dispute and any judicial
                  determination pursuant to Section 21(f) shall be final and
                  binding on the Corporation and the AlliedSignal Employer. The
                  Corporation and the responsible AlliedSignal Employer shall
                  make payments to Participants as directed by the New Plan
                  Administrator or pursuant to judicial determination pursuant
                  to Section 21(f).

         (c)      Corporation or AlliedSignal Employer Recommendations. Upon the
                  occurrence of a Change in Control, the Corporation and any
                  AlliedSignal Employer may make recommendations to the New Plan
                  Administrator with respect to benefit determinations for
                  affected Participants under the Plan and the New Plan
                  Administrator shall immediately forward any such
                  recommendation to the affected Participant. If the
                  recommendation is agreed to in writing by the Participant, the
                  New Plan Administrator shall advise the Corporation and any
                  responsible AlliedSignal Employer, and the Corporation or
                  AlliedSignal Employer, whichever is responsible, shall
                  immediately make payment.

         (d)      Independent Recommendations. In the case of a recommendation
                  which is not agreed to by the affected Participant, the New
                  Plan Administrator shall immediately review the recommendation
                  of the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer and
                  within 15 days of notice of the dispute from the Participant,
                  determine whether it is in accordance with the terms of the
                  Plan and notify the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal
                  Employer and the Participant of its findings. If the New Plan
                  Administrator determines that the recommendation is not in
                  accordance with the terms of the Plan and that an


                                      -18-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  adjustment is necessary and the Participant agrees in writing
                  to such adjustment, the New Plan Administrator shall advise
                  the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer, and the
                  Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer shall
                  immediately make payment. Any such adjustment determined by
                  the New Plan Administrator, whether agreed to by the
                  Participant or not, shall be final and binding upon the
                  Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer and may not
                  be challenged by either of them.

         (e)      Direct Application. Upon notice to the New Plan Administrator
                  by an affected Participant, as to whom the Corporation or
                  responsible AlliedSignal Employer has made no recommendation,
                  that a Covered Termination has occurred, the Corporation or
                  responsible AlliedSignal Employer shall be notified by the New
                  Plan Administrator and given 15 days from the date the
                  Participant gave notice to the new Plan Administrator within
                  which to make a recommendation as to benefit determination.
                  The New Plan Administrator shall also make its own independent
                  determination as to the benefit payable under the terms of the
                  Plan. Within 21 days of receipt of the notice from the
                  affected Participant, the New Plan Administrator shall
                  transmit to the Participant its own recommendation and that of
                  the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer if such
                  is available. If either recommendation is accepted in writing
                  by the affected Participant, the New Plan Administrator shall
                  advise the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer,
                  and the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer shall
                  immediately make payment. Any recommendation by the New Plan
                  Administrator shall be final and binding upon the Corporation
                  or responsible AlliedSignal Employer and may not be challenged
                  by either of them.

         (f)      Disputed Recommendation. If an affected Participant does not
                  agree in writing within 30 days of transmittal to accept any
                  of the recommendations made pursuant to Sections 21(c), 21(d)
                  or 21(e), the New Plan Administrator shall consider the amount
                  in excess of the highest recommendation to be a claim for
                  benefits which is in dispute and shall, with respect to such
                  amount, initiate an action in interpleader pursuant to Rule 22
                  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or analogous rules,
                  before a court of competent jurisdiction. The New Plan
                  Administrator shall not assert any claim or take any position
                  in this proceeding based on its interpretation of the terms of
                  the Plan, other than the provisions of this Section 21.

         (g)      Attorneys Fees and Costs. If a Participant is paid or is
                  determined to be entitled to receive benefits (i) in excess of
                  any recommendation made by the Corporation or responsible
                  AlliedSignal Employer pursuant to Sections 21(c) or 21(e), or
                  (ii) in a case where the Corporation or responsible
                  AlliedSignal Employer have made no recommendation pursuant to
                  Sections 21(c) or 21(e), the New Plan Administrator shall
                  advise the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer,
                  and the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal Employer shall
                  immediately pay or reimburse the affected Participant for the
                  full amount of any attorneys&#39; fees and other expenses the
                  affected Participant incurred in pursuing his or her claim for


                                      -19-




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  benefits. The payment or reimbursement shall include the
                  standard hourly rates charged by each such attorney, any and
                  all other expenses related to the action incurred by or on
                  behalf of the affected Participant, the costs and expenses of
                  any experts utilized to prepare the claim, and any court costs
                  assessed against the affected Participant.

         (h)      Undisputed Benefits. Prior to the resolution of amounts in
                  dispute under Section 21(f), the Participant shall be paid
                  immediately by the Corporation or responsible AlliedSignal
                  Employer in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the higher
                  of (i) the amount recommended, if any, by the Corporation or
                  the responsible AlliedSignal Employer, or (ii) the amount
                  recommended by the New Plan Administrator.

         (i)      Amendment or Termination. This Plan may not be amended or
                  terminated after a Change in Control; provided, however, the
                  Plan may be amended if the purpose of the amendment is to
                  increase benefits hereunder.

                              Salary Deferral Plan
                                       for
      Selected Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates
 (Career Band 6 and Above or Employees Who Occupy Positions Equivalent Thereto)













                                                            Amended and Restated
                                                           as of January 1, 2000

1. Eligibility

         Those employees of Honeywell International Inc. (the &#34;Corporation&#34;) and
its affiliates whose positions are evaluated in Career Band 6 and above or who
occupy positions equivalent thereto and who are designated by the Management
Development and Compensation Committee (the &#34;Committee&#34;) shall be eligible to
participate in this supplemental non-qualified Salary Deferral Plan for Selected
Employees of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (Career Band 6 and
Above or Employees Who Occupy Positions Equivalent Thereto) (the &#34;Plan&#34;).

2. Participation

         An eligible employee may become a participant in the Plan (a
&#34;Participant&#34;) by filing a timely written deferral election with the
Corporation. Such notice shall direct that a portion of the compensation
elements described in paragraph 3(a) and paragraph 3(b) be credited to an
unfunded deferred compensation account maintained for the Participant under the
Plan (the &#34;Participant Account&#34; or &#34;Account&#34;). A Participant&#39;s direction shall
become effective for the pay period or payment date in the next succeeding
calendar year (or for a newly eligible Participant, for the next succeeding pay
period or payment date after the receipt of the direction by the Corporation),
and shall continue in effect until the Participant terminates such direction,
effective as of the end of the calendar year, or is no longer eligible to be a
Participant. Any modification of Participant&#39;s direction shall be effective only
with respect to compensation payable with respect to pay periods in the calendar
year next following the date such direction is received by the Corporation.

3. Contributions to Participant Accounts

         (a) Base Annual Salary. A Participant may, prior to the beginning of
any calendar year (and with respect to a newly eligible Participant, within
thirty days after first becoming so eligible) elect to defer an aggregate amount
of base annual salary otherwise payable in such subsequent calendar year (or
with respect to a newly eligible Participant, in the remainder of the calendar
year), exclusive of any bonus or any other compensation or allowance paid or
payable by the Corporation or its affiliates (the &#34;Base Annual Salary&#34;). The
amount deferred under this paragraph 3(a) shall not be greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the Participant&#39;s Base Annual Salary for such pay period.

         (b) Incentive Awards. A Participant may, to the extent that the
AlliedSignal Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan For Executive Employees (the
&#34;Incentive Plan&#34;) (or any successor plan) permits deferrals of an incentive
award (the &#34;Incentive Award&#34;) payable thereunder, elect to defer an amount not
greater than one hundred percent of such Incentive Award. Any amount so deferred
shall be deemed to be deferred under this Plan but shall, to the extent the
provisions of the Incentive Plan are not inconsistent with this Plan, otherwise
be subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan. Any deferral of an Incentive
Award shall be made by filing an appropriate deferral election with the
Corporation not later than the date established by the Corporation from time to
time.

         (c) Deferral Amounts. All amounts determined under this paragraph 3
which are the subject of a written deferral election (the &#34;Deferral Amounts&#34;)
shall, in





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -3-


accordance with the relevant Participant direction, be credited to a Participant
Account maintained under the Plan on the same day the Base Annual Salary or
Incentive Award would otherwise have been payable.

4. Deferral Requirements

         Amounts may be deferred under this Plan for a minimum period of three
years or such shorter period as may be approved by the Committee. Except as
otherwise provided in paragraphs 9 or 10 or as approved by Committee, no amount
shall be withdrawn from a Participant Account prior to the earlier of: three
years following the last day of the calendar year in which the amount is
credited to the Participant Account; the date the Participant reaches normal
retirement age and is eligible to receive a benefit under a pension plan of the
Corporation or one of its affiliates; the date of Participant&#39;s death; or the
date the Participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation or any of its
affiliates.

5. Interest Equivalents

         Deferral Amounts shall accrue additional amounts equivalent to interest
(&#34;Interest Equivalents&#34;), compounded daily, from the date the Deferral Amount is
credited to the Account to the date of distribution. A single rate for
calculating Interest Equivalents shall be established by the Committee, in its
sole discretion, for all Deferral Amounts credited to Participant Accounts in
each calendar year. The rate established by the Committee shall not exceed the
greater of (i) 10% or (ii) 200% of the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond rate at the
time of determination. Such Interest Equivalents, once established for a
calendar year, shall remain in effect with respect to Deferral Amounts credited
to Participant Accounts during the calendar year until the Deferral Amounts are
distributed.

         The rate of notional interest established by the Committee shall be set
forth on Schedule A attached hereto and made a part hereof. Any portion of such
rate designated as &#34;Vested Rate&#34; on such Schedule A shall be nonforfeitable at
all times. Any portion of such rate designated as &#34;Contingent Rate&#34; shall become
nonforfeitable only if the Employee is still employed by the Company at the end
of the third full calendar year following the calendar year in which the Award
relates, provided, however, in the event a Participant terminates employment
with the Corporation or an affiliate prior to such date for reasons other than
gross cause, the Committee shall treat such portion as nonforfeitable in the
event the Participant&#39;s employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated
(including a termination for &#34;good reason&#34; under any applicable severance plan
of the Company) or is terminated for such reasons as the Committee may determine
from time to time in its sole discretion. The rate established by the Committee
and set forth on Schedule A shall remain in effect until superceded by action of
the Committee and amendment of such Schedule A.

6. Participant Accounts

         All amounts credited to a Participant&#39;s Account pursuant to paragraphs
3 and 4 shall be unfunded general obligations of the Corporation, and no
Participant shall have any claim to or security interest in any asset of the
Corporation on account thereof.

7. Distribution from Accounts

         At the time a Participant makes an election pursuant to paragraph 3,
the Participant shall also make an election with respect to the distribution of
the Deferral Amounts and Interest Equivalents accrued thereon which are credited
to the Participant&#39;s Account pursuant to such election. A Participant may elect
to receive such distribution in one lump-sum payment or in a number of
approximately equal annual payments (provided the payment period may not include
more than fifteen such installments). The lump-sum or the first installment
shall be paid as soon as practicable during the month of January of the calendar
year designated by the Participant. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs
8, 9 and 10, all installment payments following the initial installment payment
shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable during the month of January of each
succeeding calendar year until the entire amount in the Account shall have been
paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an Employee&#39;s employment with
the Company is terminated either voluntarily (other than on account of
retirement as defined in the qualified pension plan in which the Participant
participates or for &#34;good reason&#34; under any applicable severance plan of the
Company) or for &#34;gross cause&#34; (as defined in the AlliedSignal Inc. Severance
Plan for Senior Executives), the nonforfeitable portion of such Employee&#39;s
Deferred Awards for performance years beginning after 1997 (including the vested
portion of any applicable notional interest credited thereto) shall be
distributed in a lump sum as soon as practicable in January of the calendar year
following such termination of employment.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, a
Participant shall be given a one-time opportunity prior to January 1, 2001 to
make a new election with respect to the distribution of all Deferral Amounts and
Interest Equivalents accrued thereon which are credited to such Participant
under the Plan (other than any such amounts otherwise payable, or part of a
series of payments payable, in January 2001), including a new election with
respect to any payments to be made in connection with a Change in Control as
described in paragraph 10, provided, however, that any such election shall only
be authorized by the Corporation if it results in a further deferral of the
distribution of the Participant&#39;s Deferral Amounts and Interest Equivalents from
that previously elected. Such election shall be effective upon a &#34;Merger&#34; of the
Corporation and General Electric Company (as defined in the Agreement and Plan
of Merger between Honeywell International Inc. and General Electric Company
dated October 22, 2000) and acceptance of such election by the Corporation. Any
such election shall be subject to such restrictions and limitations as the
Corporation shall determine in its sole discretion.






&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -5-


8. Distribution on Death

         If a Participant should die before all amounts credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account have been distributed, the balance in the Account shall be
paid as soon as practical thereafter to the beneficiary designated in writing by
the Participant. Payments to a beneficiary pursuant to a designation by a
Participant shall be in such form as the Participant shall elect, including
periodic payments as described in paragraph 7, but in the absence of any such
election, the payment shall be made in one lump sum to the designated
beneficiary as soon as practicable following the death of the Participant. Such
beneficiary designations shall be effective when received by the Corporation,
and shall remain in effect until rescinded or modified by the Participant by an
appropriate written direction. If no beneficiary is properly designed by the
Participant or if the designated beneficiary shall have predeceased the
Participant, such balance in the Account shall be paid to the estate of the
Participant.

9. Payment in the Event of Hardship

         Upon receipt of a request from a Participant or a Participant&#39;s
designated beneficiary, delivered in writing to the Corporation along with a
Certificate of Unavailability of Other Resources form, the Committee, the Senior
Vice President - Human Resources and Communications, or his designee, may cause
the Corporation to accelerate (or require the subsidiary of the Corporation
which employs or employed the Participant to accelerate) payment of all or any
part of the Deferral Amount and Interest Equivalents credited to the
Participant&#39;s Account, if it finds in its sole discretion that payment of such
amounts in accordance with the Participant&#39;s prior election under paragraph 3
would result in severe financial hardship to the Participant or beneficiary and
such hardship is the result of an unforeseeable emergency caused by
circumstances beyond the control of the Participant or the Participant&#39;s
beneficiary. Acceleration of payment may not be made under this paragraph 9 to
the extent that such hardship is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Participant&#39;s
assets, to the extent the liquidation of assets would not itself cause severe
financial hardship or (iii) by cessation of deferrals under this Plan or any
tax-qualified savings plan of the Corporation.

10. Change in Control

         (a) Initial Lump Sum Election. Notwithstanding any election made
pursuant to paragraph 7, a Participant may file a written election with the
Corporation to have the Deferral Amounts and Interest Equivalents accrued
thereon which are credited thereafter to the Participant&#39;s Account paid in one
lump-sum payment as soon as practicable following a Change in Control, but in no
event later than 90 days after such Change in Control. The Interest Equivalents
on any Deferred Amount payable pursuant to this paragraph 10(a) shall include
the &#34;Contingent Rate&#34; credited to such Deferred Amount without regard to whether
such amount has become nonforfeitable as provided in paragraph 5 at the time
payment is made under this paragraph 10(a).

         (b) Revocation of Lump-Sum Election. A Participant may revoke an
election made pursuant to paragraph 10(a) by filing an appropriate written
notice with the Corporation. A revocation notice filed pursuant to this
paragraph 10(b) shall be subject





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -6-


to such terms and conditions as the Corporation shall establish and shall be
effective with respect to any or all of the Participant&#39;s Deferral Amounts and
Interest Equivalents accrued thereon which are credited to such Participant
under the Plan. Any revocation notice made before January 1, 2001 shall be
effective upon a &#34;Merger&#34; of the Corporation and General Electric Company (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Honeywell International Inc.
and General Electric Company dated October 22, 2000) and acceptance of such
election by the Corporation. Any such election shall be subject to such
restrictions and limitations as the Corporation shall determine in its sole
discretion.

         (c) Limitation on Elections. Any election made pursuant to paragraph
10(a) or 10(b) shall not be effective unless filed with the Corporation at least
90 days prior to a Change in Control.

         (d) Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of the Plan, a Change
in Control is deemed to occur at the time (i) when an entity, person or group
(other than the Corporation, any subsidiary or savings, pension or other benefit
plan for the benefit of employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries) which
theretofore beneficially owned less than 30% of the Corporation&#39;s common stock
(the &#34;Common Stock&#34;) then outstanding, acquires shares of Common Stock in a
transaction or a series of transactions that results in such entity, person or
group directly or indirectly owning beneficially 30% or more of the outstanding
Common Stock, (ii) of the purchase of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer (other than an offer by the Corporation) for all, or any part of,
the Common Stock (iii) of a merger in which the Corporation will not survive as
an independent, publicly owned corporation, a consolidation, a sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation&#39;s assets, (iv)
of a substantial change in the composition of the Board during any period of two
consecutive years such that individuals who at the beginning of such period were
members of the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
thereof, unless the election, or the nomination for election by the shareowners
of the Corporation, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least
two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the
beginning of the period, or (v) of any transaction or other event which the
Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to be a Change in Control for
purposes of the Plan.

11. Miscellaneous

         (a) No Alienation of Benefits. Except insofar as may otherwise be
required by law, no amount payable at any time under the Plan shall be subject
in any manner to alienation by anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment,
bankruptcy, pledge, attachment, charge, or encumbrance of any kind nor in any
manner be subject to the debts or liabilities of any person and any attempt to
so alienate or subject any such amount, whether presently or thereafter payable,
shall be void. If any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, attach, charge, or otherwise encumber any amount
payable under the Plan, or any part thereof, or if by reason of such person&#39;s
bankruptcy or other event happening at any such time such amount would be made
subject to the person&#39;s debts or liabilities or would otherwise not be enjoyed
by that person, then the Corporation, if it so elects, may direct that such
amount be withheld and that same or any part thereof be paid or applied to or
for the benefit of such person,





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -7-


the person&#39;s spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, in such
manner and proportion as the Corporation may deem proper.

         (b) No Right or Interest in Corporation&#39;s Assets. Neither the
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to reserve or otherwise
set aside funds for the payment of obligations arising under this Plan. The
Corporation may, in its sole discretion, establish funds, segregate assets or
take such other action as it shall determine necessary or appropriate to secure
the payment of its obligations arising under this Plan. This Plan is intended to
be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Nothing contained herein,
and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create or be
construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the
Corporation and any Participant or any other person. To the extent that any
person acquires a right to receive payments under this Plan, such right shall be
no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Corporation.

         (c) Administration. The Corporation shall have sole discretion and
authority to administer the Plan, including the authority to interpret its
terms, promulgate regulations thereunder, determine eligibility to participate
in the Plan and make any finding of fact which may be necessary to determine the
obligation of the Plan with respect to the payment of benefits.

         (d) Amendment. The Corporation may amend, modify or terminate the Plan
at any time, or from time to time; provided, however, that no change to the Plan
shall impair the right of any Participant with respect to amounts then credited
to an Account.

         (e) Accounting. Each Participant shall receive periodic statements (not
less frequently than annually) setting forth the cumulative Deferral Amounts and
Interest Equivalents credited to, and any distributions from, the Participant&#39;s
Account.

         (f) Facility of Payments. If the Corporation shall find that any person
to whom any amount is payable under the plan is unable to care for his or her
affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any
payment due the person or the person&#39;s estate (unless a prior claim therefore
has been made by a duly appointed legal representative), may, if the Corporation
so elects in its sole discretion, be paid to the person&#39;s spouse, a child, a
relative, an institution having custody of such person, or any other person
deemed by the Corporation to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person
otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of
the liability of the Corporation and the Plan therefore.

         (g) Governing Law. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded
deferred compensation arrangement for a select group of management or highly
compensated personnel and all rights thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of New York.

Article I - Purpose

                Effective November 20, 1975, Allied Corporation adopted the
Allied Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives and Key
Employees. Such plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2000 as the
Honeywell International Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan (the &#34;Plan&#34;).

                The purpose of the Plan is to provide retired participants and
their joint annuitants and beneficiaries under the Pension Plan with the amount
of retirement income that is not provided under the Pension Plan because the
participant deferred compensation under one or more nonqualified deferred
compensation plans of Honeywell International Inc., including the Incentive
Plan, the Supplemental Savings Plans and the Salary Deferral Plan or, by reason
of the limits imposed by Section 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code. The Plan is
also intended to cover any contractual obligation Allied has to pay pension
benefits which cannot be provided under the provisions of the Pension Plan.

                Except to the extent otherwise indicated, and to the extent
otherwise inappropriate, the Pension Plan and the provisions thereof are hereby
incorporated by reference.

              (a)     those participants in the Pension Plan (and their joint
                      annuitants and beneficiaries) who as a result of having
                      deferred an award under the Incentive Plan or having
                      deferred compensation under the Supplemental Savings Plans
                      or the Salary Deferral Plan, receive or shall receive a
                      lesser amount under the Pension Plan than would otherwise

              (b)     those participants in the Pension Plan (and their joint
                      annuitants and beneficiaries) who as a result of the
                      limitations contained in Code Sections 415 or 401(a)(17)
                      receive or will receive a lesser amount under the Pension

              (c)     any employee who has entered into a contractual agreement
                      with Honeywell under which Honeywell shall, after the
                      termination of employment of the employee, provide a
                      benefit in the form of a life annuity for the employee

                      provided under the terms of the contractual agreement.


Article IV - Supplemental Benefit

4.01          Payment of Supplemental Benefit

              (a)     Supplemental Benefits shall be payable directly to such
                      participant, or such participant&#39;s joint annuitant or
                      beneficiary, as applicable, from the general assets of
                      Honeywell and Honeywell shall not be under any obligation
                      to set aside any funds or other assets for the payment of
                      the Supplemental Benefits under this Plan. Honeywell may,
                      in its sole discretion, establish funds for payment of
                      these Supplemental Benefits. However, any and all such
                      funds shall remain assets of Honeywell and subject to the
                      claims of creditors of such corporation. Such funds, if
                      any, shall not be deemed to be assets of this Plan.

                      Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Committee is
                      authorized (but not required) to cause AlliedSignal (or
                      any successor thereto) to fund all or a part of the
                      Supplemental Benefits for such participant or participants
                      as it may select in its sole discretion from time to time.
                      The amount of such funded Supplemental Benefits shall not
                      be assets of Honeywell and shall not be subject to the
                      claims of creditors of Honeywell. Such participants, if
                      any, and the amount of any funded Supplemental Benefits
                      shall be designated in Appendix A and the





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -5-


                      Supplemental Benefits of any participant not designated in
                      Appendix A or the portion of any Supplemental Benefit not
                      funded as designated in Appendix A shall not be so funded
                      and shall remain subject to the provisions of the
                      preceding paragraph of this Section 4.01(a). A participant
                      designated on Appendix A who is married on the date any
                      funded Supplemental Benefits commence under Section
                      4.01(b) must obtain the written consent of the
                      participant&#39;s spouse in the form and manner prescribed by
                      the Committee to the election of any form of payment of
                      such funded Supplemental Benefits other than a 50% joint
                      and survivor annuity with the participant&#39;s spouse
                      designated as the joint annuitant. The Committee is
                      authorized to select, appoint and remove trustees or other
                      entities or individuals, to enter into, amend and
                      terminate trust or other agreements, to create trust or
                      other secured funds, to cause Honeywell to make
                      contributions to such funds in such amounts as the
                      Committee may determine from time to time and to take all
                      other actions that it may determine to be necessary or
                      helpful in implementing the funding, including providing
                      for the payment of Supplemental Benefits in accordance
                      with applicable law.

              (b)     Any person entitled to a Supplemental Benefit shall be
                      entitled to payment of such benefit only from the date on
                      which such Supplemental Benefit becomes due and payable
                      and only in such installments or other manner of payment
                      as is provided under the relevant Pension Plan or
                      agreement, provided, however, that if a Participant so
                      elects, by giving written notice to the Plan
                      Administrator, and if the Committee approves such
                      election, payment of such Supplemental Benefit shall be in
                      a lump sum equal to the present value of such
                      Participant&#39;s Supplemental Benefit accrued to the date of
                      such Participant&#39;s retirement under the relevant Pension
                      Plan or agreement (or the lump sum value of the
                      Supplemental Benefit calculated with reference to the
                      Retirement Earnings Plan provisions of any Pension Plan).
                      For the purpose of determining the present value of a
                      Participant&#39;s accrued Supplemental Benefit, the
                      &#34;Applicable Mortality Table&#34; and the &#34;Applicable Interest
                      Rate&#34; shall be used, as defined below. Except as may be
                      permitted pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of
                      this Paragraph (b), no person shall have a right to
                      acceleration of any such payment. No person shall be
                      entitled to anticipate such benefit by assignment, pledge
                      or transfer in any form or manner prior to actual or
                      constructive receipt of payment.

                           (1)   The &#34;Applicable Mortality Table&#34; means the
                                 mortality table prescribed by the Secretary of
                                 the Treasury pursuant to Code Section 417(e).
                                 Such table shall be based on the prevailing
                                 commissioners&#39; standard table (described in
                                 Code Section 807(d)(5)(A)) used to determine
                                 reserves for group annuity contracts issued on
                                 the date as of which the





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -6-



                                 present value is being determined (without
                                 regard to any other subparagraph of Code
                                 Section 807(d)(5)).

                           (2)   The &#34;Applicable Interest Rate&#34; means the
                                 average annual rate of interest on 30-year
                                 Treasury securities determined as of the third
                                 calendar month preceding the month during which
                                 the benefit commencement occurs.

              (c)     In the event that a Supplemental Benefit becomes payable
                      in accordance with this Article IV, Section 4.01,
                      Paragraph (b) and in the event the relevant Pension Plan
                      or agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
                      then the Participant shall have a right to only the
                      Supplemental Benefit accrued to the date of termination of
                      the relevant Pension Plan or agreement. In such event,
                      Honeywell shall remain liable for the payment of the
                      Supplemental Benefit and payment shall be made at such
                      times and in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall
                      determine, unless the Participant shall have made the
                      election referred to in Paragraph (b) of this Section
                      4.01, in which event payment shall be made pursuant to
                      such election, if approved by the Committee as therein
                      required. Such accrued Supplemental Benefit shall remain
                      subject to Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.01.

              (d)     Except to the extent that a participant&#39;s Supplemental
                      Benefits are funded as described in Section 4.01(a), the
                      rights and interest of any participant, joint annuitant,
                      or beneficiary to a Supplemental Benefit under this Plan
                      shall be the same as any other unsecured creditor of
                      Honeywell (or any successor thereto). In the event of any
                      bankruptcy proceeding by or against Honeywell, a
                      participant, joint annuitant or beneficiary shall be
                      entitled to prove a claim for any unpaid portion of the
                      benefit provided by the Plan.


Article V - Administration

5.01          Plan Administrator - The Board of Directors shall name a Plan
              Administrator. Such Plan Administrator shall serve at the
              convenience of the Board of Directors and shall serve without
              compensation. The Plan Administrator shall keep such records as
              necessary for the proper administration of the Plan and shall
              report to the Board of Directors at such time or times as the
              Board of Directors shall designate.

5.02          Benefit Determination - The Plan Administrator shall determine the
              amount and timing of any benefit paid under the Plan. The Plan
              Administrator shall rely on the records of Honeywell in
              determining any participant&#39;s eligibility for and amount of
              benefit under the Plan. In the event that the Plan Administrator&#39;s
              reliance on the records of Honeywell causes a benefit to be over
              or under paid, the Plan Administrator shall adjust future payments
              to be increased or decreased as required. If such future payments
              are insufficient to recover any overpayment to a





&lt;PAGE&gt;
                                      -7-



              participant, the Plan Administrator shall withhold any payments
              then due a participant and take any action deemed appropriate to
              recover the balance of the overpayment.

5.03          Benefit Appeals - The Plan Administrator shall establish an
              appeals procedure as defined by U.S. Department of Labor
              regulations. Such procedures will provide that the participant has
              sixty (60) days upon receipt of any benefits or denial of benefits
              to file an appeal with the Plan Administrator. The Plan
              Administrator must respond within sixty (60) days of receiving the
              appeal, in writing, specifically identifying those Plan provisions
              on which the benefit denial was based and indicating what
              information the participant must supply in order to perfect a
              claim for benefits.

5.04          Nonduplication of Benefits - To avoid the duplication of benefits,
              the amount of any similar benefits under this Plan shall be offset
              and reduced by the amount of any similar benefit provided the
              participant under other supplemental pension plans sponsored by
              Honeywell International Inc. (other than the Honeywell
              International Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for
              Executives in Career Band 6 and Above) for which the participant
              may be eligible, regardless of whether the payments under this
              Plan are made at an earlier or a later date than payments under a
              similar plan would have been made.

Article VI - Amendment and Termination

6.01          Plan Amendments - Honeywell reserves the right to amend the plan
              from time to time. The Plan may be amended by the Committee;
              provided however, that no amendment shall reduce any benefit being
              paid or then payable to a participant. Further, no amendment shall
              reduce the benefits provided by the Plan to participants or alter
              in any manner the rights of the participants to benefits provided
              under this Plan.

6.02          Plan Termination - Honeywell reserves the right to terminate the
              Plan. However, such termination shall not adversely affect the
              rights of participants.

         by the Committee) and shall thereafter constitute a separate plan,
         program or arrangement with terms and provisions identical to this
         Plan. Supplemental Benefits under such separate plan, program or
         arrangement and this Plan shall be calculated to avoid duplication or
         omission of benefits.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    BENEFITS

4.1  Amount of Benefit. Subject to the terms of this Article IV, a Participant
     shall receive a monthly Supplemental Benefit. The monthly Supplemental
     Benefit shall be determined by comparing (a) the sum of the monthly
     retirement benefits (normal or early) actually payable to the Participant
     under the Pension Plan(s) and the Supplemental Pension Plan (as applied to
     the applicable Pension Plan(s)) in accordance with the distribution method
     selected by the Participant, and (b) the sum of the monthly retirement
     benefits (normal or early) that would be payable to the Participant under
     the Retirement Program and the Supplemental Pension Plan (as applied to the
     Retirement Program) if all of the Participant&#39;s Credited Service had been
     earned solely under the Retirement Program and if such Participant had made
     the same distribution method election as under (a) above. The monthly
     Supplemental Benefit shall equal the amount, if any, by which (b) exceeds
     (a) for the applicable monthly period.

4.2  Payment of Benefit. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.3, the
     Supplemental Benefit shall generally be paid at the same time benefits are
     paid to the Participant under the applicable Pension Plan(s). The
     Supplemental Benefit shall be paid directly to the Participant or, in the
     event of the Participant&#39;s death, to the Participant&#39;s Beneficiary.

4.3  Form of Payment. The Supplemental Benefit shall generally be paid in the
     same form as the retirement benefit payable to the Participant under the
     applicable Pension Plan(s). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, however,
     a Participant may request that payment of his or her Supplemental Benefit
     be made in a single lump sum payment. Any such request shall be made in
     writing to the Plan Administrator, whose decision with respect thereto
     shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons having or claiming
     to have any right or interest under this Plan. Any lump sum payment
     approved under this Section 4.3 shall be actuarially equivalent to the
     Participant&#39;s Supplemental Benefit. For this purpose, actuarial equivalence
     shall be determined by using the &#34;applicable mortality table&#34; and the
     &#34;applicable interest rate&#34; described in Section 417(e) of the Code,
     provided that the applicable interest rate shall be determined as of the
     third calendar month preceding the month during which the benefit
     commencement date occurs.


4.4  Death and Disability Benefits. As more fully described in Section 4.1, this
     Plan provides benefits only for Executives who are receiving early or
     normal retirement benefits under a Pension Plan. The Plan does not provide
     pre-retirement death benefits, disability benefits or any other type of
     ancillary benefits that may be available under the Retirement Program or
     the applicable Pension Plan.


                                    ARTICLE V

                                 ADMINISTRATION

     Administrator shall have the authority to appoint one or more other named
     fiduciaries of the Plan and to designate persons, other than named
     fiduciaries, to carry out fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan,
     pursuant to Section 405(c)(1)(B) of ERISA.

5.2  Powers and Duties of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have
     the full discretionary power and authority to construe and interpret the
     Plan (including, without limitation, supplying omissions from, correcting
     deficiencies in, or resolving inconsistencies or ambiguities in, the
     language of the Plan); to determine all questions of fact arising under the
     Plan, including questions as to eligibility for and the amount of benefits;
     to establish such rules and regulations (consistent with the terms of the
     Plan) as it deems necessary or appropriate for administration of the Plan;
     to delegate responsibilities to others to assist it in administering the
     Plan; to retain attorneys, consultants, accountants, actuaries or other
     persons (who may be employees of the Company) to render advice and
     assistance as it shall determine to be necessary to effect the proper
     discharge of any duty for which it is responsible; to prepare and
     distribute to Participants information explaining the Plan; to prescribe
     procedures to be followed by Participants and Beneficiaries filing
     applications for benefits; and to perform all other acts it believes
     reasonable and proper in connection with the administration of the Plan.
     The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely on the records of the
     Company in determining any Participant&#39;s entitlement to and the amount of
     benefits payable under the Plan. Any determination of the Plan
     Administrator, including interpretations of the Plan and determinations of
     questions of fact, shall be final and binding on all parties.

5.3  Indemnification. To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall
     indemnify the Plan Administrator and his delegates from all claims for
     liability, loss, or damage (including payment of expenses in connection
     with defense against such claims) arising from any act or failure to act in
     connection with the Plan.

5.4  Records. The Plan Administrator shall keep or cause to be kept such records
     and shall prepare or cause to be prepared such returns or reports as may be
     required by law or necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. All
     resolutions, proceedings, acts and determinations of the Plan Administrator
     shall be recorded by the Plan Administrator and such records, together with
     any documents and instruments as may be necessary for the administration of
     the Plan, shall be preserved in the custody of the Plan Administrator.

5.5  Information from Participants. Each Participant shall be required to
     furnish to the Plan Administrator, in the form prescribed by it, such
     personal data, affidavits, authorizations to obtain information, and other
     information as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate for the proper
     administration of the Plan.

5.6  Reliance. The Plan Administrator and its delegates shall be entitled to
     rely upon all valuations, certificates and reports furnished by any actuary
     or accountant selected by the Plan Administrator or any delegate and upon
     all opinions given by any legal counsel selected by the Plan Administrator
     or any delegate. The Plan




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     Administrator and its delegates shall be fully protected with respect to
     any action taken or suffered by their having relied in good faith upon such
     actuary, accountant or counsel and all action so taken or suffered shall be
     conclusive upon each of them and upon all Participants and their
     Beneficiaries.

5.7  Compensation and Expenses. Unless authorized by the Board, neither the Plan
     Administrator nor its delegates shall be compensated for service in such
     capacity, but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incident to the
     performance of such duties.

5.8  Claims Procedures and Appeals. Any claim or appeal under this Plan shall be
     subject to the following rules:

     (a)  Any request or claim for Plan benefits must be made in writing and
          shall be deemed to be filed by a Participant when a written request is
          made by the claimant or the claimant&#39;s authorized representative which
          is reasonably calculated to bring the claim to the attention of the
          Plan Administrator.

     (b)  The Plan Administrator shall provide notice in writing to any
          Participant when a claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied
          in whole or in part. Such notice shall be provided within 90 days of
          the receipt by the Plan Administrator of the Participant&#39;s claim or,
          if special circumstances require, and the Participant is so notified
          in writing, within 180 days of the receipt by the Plan Administrator
          of the Participant&#39;s claim. The notice shall be written in a manner
          calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall:

          (i)  set forth the specific reasons for the denial of benefits;

          (ii) contain specific references to Plan provisions relative to the
               denial;

         (iii) describe any material and information, if any, necessary for the
               claim for benefits to be allowed, that had been requested, but
               not received by the Plan Administrator; and

          (iv) advise the Participant that any appeal of the Plan
               Administrator&#39;s adverse determination must be made in writing to
               the Plan Administrator within 60 days after receipt of the
               initial denial notification, and must set forth the facts upon
               which the appeal is based.

     (c)  If notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished within the time
          periods set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied and the
          claimant shall be permitted to proceed to the review procedures set
          forth below. If the Participant fails to appeal the Plan
          Administrator&#39;s denial of benefits in writing and within 60 days after
          receipt by the claimant of written notification of denial of the claim
          (or within 60 days after a deemed denial of the claim), the Plan
          Administrator&#39;s determination shall become final and conclusive.




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     (d)  If the Participant appeals the Plan Administrator&#39;s denial of benefits
          in a timely fashion, the Plan Administrator shall re-examine all
          issues relevant to the original denial of benefits. Any such claimant,
          or his or her duly authorized representative, may review any pertinent
          documents, as determined by the Plan Administrator, and submit in
          writing any issues or comments to be addressed on appeal.

     (e)  The Plan Administrator shall advise the Participant and such
          individual&#39;s representative of its decision, which shall be written in
          a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and include
          specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the
          decision is based. Such response shall be made within 60 days of
          receipt of the written appeal, unless special circumstances require an
          extension of such 60-day period for not more than an additional 60
          days. Where such extension is necessary, the claimant shall be given
          written notice of the delay. If the decision on review is not
          furnished within the time set forth above, the claim shall be deemed
          denied on review.

     (f)  Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to any
          Plan benefit, including, without limitation, any dispute controversy
          or claim as to whether the decision of the Plan Administrator
          respecting the benefits under this Plan or interpretation of this Plan
          is arbitrary and capricious, that is not settled in accordance with
          the procedures outlined in this Section 5.8, shall be settled by final
          and binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration
          Association Employment Dispute Resolution or other applicable Rules.
          Before resorting to arbitration, an aggrieved Participant must first
          follow the review procedure outlined in this Section of the Plan. If
          there is still a dispute after the procedures in this Section have
          been exhausted, the Participant must request arbitration in writing
          within six (6) months after the Plan Administrator issues, or is
          deemed to have issued, its determination under subparagraph (e) above.

          The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties,
          if possible. If the parties fail to reach agreement upon appointment
          of an arbitrator within 30 days following receipt by one party of the
          other party&#39;s notice of desire to arbitrate, the arbitrator shall be
          selected from a panel or panels of persons submitted by the American
          Arbitration Association (the &#34;AAA&#34;). The selection process shall be
          that which is set forth in the AAA Employment Dispute Resolution
          Rules, except that, if the parties fail to select an arbitrator from
          one or more panels, AAA shall not have the power to make an
          appointment but shall continue to submit additional panels until an
          arbitrator has been selected.

          All fees and expenses of the arbitration, including a transcript if
          requested, will be borne by the Company. The arbitrator shall have no
          power to amend, add to or subtract from this Plan. The award shall be
          admissible in any court or agency action seeking to enforce or render
          unenforceable this Plan or any portion thereof. Any action to enforce
          or vacate the arbitrator&#39;s award shall be governed by the Federal
          Arbitration Act if applicable.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          PLAN AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION

6.1  Right to Amend. The Company shall have the right at any time to amend the
     Plan. No such amendment shall have the effect specified in Section 6.3.

6.2  Right of the Company to Terminate Plan. The Company intends and expects
     that from year to year it will be able to and will deem it advisable to
     continue this Plan in effect. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, the
     Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time.

6.3  Restrictions on Amendment or Termination. No amendment or termination of
     the Plan shall be made which would adversely affect any Participant&#39;s
     benefit under this Plan (determined in accordance with the terms of the
     applicable Pension Plans and Supplemental Pension Plans in effect on the
     day immediately preceding such amendment or termination) or that would
     adversely affect the benefit that is being paid to any person at the time
     of such amendment or termination. The prohibitions of this Section 6.3
     shall apply notwithstanding any legal right or ability of the Company to
     amend or terminate this Plan.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

7.1  No Assignment of Benefit. No benefit under the Plan, nor any other interest
     hereunder of any Participant or Beneficiary shall be assignable,
     transferable or subject to sale, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation,
     commutation, anticipation, garnishment, attachment, execution, or levy of
     any kind, and the Plan Administrator shall not recognize any attempt to
     assign, transfer, sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, commute or
     anticipate the same, except to the extent required by law and except that
     no amount shall be payable hereunder until and unless any and all amounts
     representing debts or other obligations owed to the Company by the
     Participant with respect to whom such amount would otherwise be payable
     shall have been fully paid and satisfied.

7.2  No Implied Rights to Employment. The adoption and maintenance of this Plan
     shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Company and any
     employee or to be a consideration for or condition of employment of any
     person. No provision of the Plan shall be deemed to give any employee the
     right to continue in the employ of the Company or to interfere with the
     right of the Company to discharge any employee at any time without regard
     to the effect which such discharge might have upon the employee&#39;s
     participation in the Plan or benefits under it.

7.3  Unsecured General Creditor. Benefits payable under this Plan shall be
     general, unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall not be
     required to set aside funds for the payment of its obligations hereunder.
     However, the Company




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     may, in its sole discretion, establish funds for the payment of its
     obligations hereunder. In such case, however, no Participant or Beneficiary
     shall have any title to or beneficial ownership in any assets which the
     Company may earmark to pay benefits hereunder. Any such funds shall remain
     assets of the Company and subject to the claims of its general creditors.
     The Plan is intended to be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of
     Title I of ERISA.

7.4  Employment with More than One Company. If any Participant shall be entitled
     to benefits under a Pension Plan on account of service with more than one
     business of the Company, the obligations under this Plan shall be
     apportioned among such Company businesses on the basis of service with
     each.

7.5  Effect of Adverse Determination. Notwithstanding any provision set forth
     herein, if the Internal Revenue Service determines, for any reason, that
     all or any portion of the amounts credited under this Plan is currently
     includible in the taxable income of any Participant, then the amounts so
     determined to be includible in income shall be distributed in a lump sum to
     such Participant as soon as practicable.

7.6  Payment of Benefits. If the Plan Administrator determines that a person
     entitled to receive any benefit payment is under a legal disability or is
     incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial
     affairs, the Plan Administrator may direct the Company to make payments to
     the Participant&#39;s legal representative or to a relative or other person for
     the Participant&#39;s benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such
     person in such manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable. Any
     payment of a benefit in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.6
     shall be complete discharge of any liability to make such payment.

7.7  Effectuation of Intent. In the event it should become impossible for the
     Company or the Plan Administrator to perform any act required by the Plan,
     the Company or Plan Administrator may perform such other act as it in good
     faith determines will most nearly carry out the intent and purposes of the
     Plan.

7.8  Headings. The headings of Articles and Sections of this Plan are for
     convenience of reference only, and in case of conflict between any such
     headings and the text of this Plan, the text shall govern.

7.9  Copy of Plan. An executed copy of the Plan shall be available for
     inspection by any Executive or other person entitled to benefits under the
     Plan at reasonable times at the offices of the Company.

7.10 Rules of Construction. Masculine pronouns used herein shall refer to men or
     women or both and nouns and pronouns when stated in the singular shall
     include the plural and when stated in the plural shall include the
     singular, wherever appropriate.

7.11 Governing Law. This Plan and its provisions shall be construed in
     accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent such
     Delaware law is not inconsistent with the provisions of ERISA.




&lt;PAGE&gt;


7.12 Severability. If any provision of this Plan is held invalid, the invalidity
     shall not affect other provisions of the Plan which can be given effect
     without the invalid provision, and to this end the provisions of this Plan
     shall be severable.

7.13 Expense of Administration. The reasonable expenses incident to the
     operation of the Plan shall be paid by the Company.

7.14 Successors. This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
     Company, its successors and assigns and each Participant and his heirs,
     executors, administrators and legal representatives.

                                    HONEYWELL
                  SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN

                         (December 31, 2000 Restatement)

                                    SECTION 1
                                  INTRODUCTION

1.1. Preambles. Honeywell International Inc., a Delaware corporation, maintains
a tax qualified defined benefit plan known as the Honeywell International Inc.
Retirement Earnings Plan (the &#34;Retirement Earnings Plan&#34;), a successor to the
Honeywell Retirement Benefit Plan. Benefits in the Retirement Earnings Plan are
restricted by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended (the &#34;Code&#34;), and by the non-recognition of certain types of
compensation.

Section 3(36) and section 4(b)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, (&#34;ERISA&#34;) recognize and authorize the establishment of an
unfunded, nonqualified plan of deferred compensation maintained by an employer
solely for the purpose of providing benefits for employees in excess of the
limitations on benefits imposed under section 415 of the Code. Sections 201, 301
and 401 of ERISA also recognize the creation of an unfunded, nonqualified plan
maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

On April 20, 1976, Honeywell Inc. (&#34;Honeywell&#34;) established the Honeywell
Supplementary Retirement Plan for the Purpose of providing the full benefits
promised to employees under the Honeywell Retirement Benefit Plan without regard
to the limitation on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code. On July 1,
1989, Honeywell established the Honeywell Supplementary Executive Retirement
Plan For Compensation In Excess Of $200,000 for the purpose of providing the
full benefits promised to employees under the Honeywell Retirement Benefit Plan
without regard to the limitation on compensation imposed by section 401(a)(17)
of the Code. On January 1, 1985, Honeywell established the Honeywell
Supplementary Retirement Plan For CECP Participants for the purpose of providing
the full benefits promised to employees under the Honeywell Retirement Benefit
Plan without regard to the exclusion from earnings of deferred incentive awards
paid under the Honeywell Corporate Executive Compensation Plan (collectively,
&#34;the SERPs&#34;).

Each of the SERPs was amended and restated effective September 20, 1994. The
SERPs were amended, completely restated and consolidated into one plan and
completely superseded each Prior Plan Statement effective for persons retiring
on or after January 1, 1998. The consolidated plan was designated as the
Honeywell Supplemental Defined Benefit Retirement Plan (the &#34;Plan&#34;). Honeywell
Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc. on
December 4, 1999. Effective April 1, 2000, the Plan has been amended principally
to recognize employee deferrals under the Honeywell International Inc.
Supplemental Savings Plans as &#34;earnings&#34; under the Plan. The Plan is intended to
be, in part, an unfunded excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36)
ERISA and, in part, an unfunded plan maintained primarily for


                                       1




&lt;PAGE&gt;


the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management
or highly compensated employees as provided in sections 201(2), 301(3) and
401(a)(1) of ERISA (except as otherwise provided in Table III).

     person or committee to whom such duties may be delegated by the Board of
     Directors.

     1.2.4. Effective Date - December 4, 1999 (except that provisions of the

extent that federal law is controlling and except for its law respecting choice
of law, be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
New Jersey.

                                    SECTION 2
                          ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

2.1. Participation. An employee is eligible to participate in and receive
benefits under this Plan if the employee satisfies the requirements of either
Section 2.1.1 or Section 2.1.2:

     2.1.1. General Participation Requirements. The employee (a) (i) is eligible
     to commence a normal or early retirement benefit under the Base Plan when
     employment terminates, (ii) dies while still actively employed by Honeywell
     with a vested benefit in the Base Plan, (iii) has been granted a vested
     benefit in this Plan, or (iv) has been specifically selected by the
     Committee to participate in this Plan; and

          (b) has a benefit in the Base Plan that is reduced on account of (i)
     the benefit limitation under section 415 of the Code or (ii) the
     compensation limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (iii) the
     provision in the Base Plan excluding from earnings (A) any deferred
     incentive awards paid under the Honeywell Corporate Executive Compensation
     Plan or the AlliedSignal Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive
     Employees (or any successor plans), or (B) any deferrals by the employee
     under the Supplemental Savings Plan.

     2.1.2. Minimum Benefit Participation Requirements. The employee fails to
     satisfy the general participation requirements of Section 2.1.1 and has a
     benefit in the Base Plan that, after excluding from earnings any deferred
     incentive awards paid under the Honeywell Corporate Executive Compensation
     Plan, the AlliedSignal Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive
     Employees (or any successor plans) and application of the benefit
     limitation under section 415 of the Code and the compensation limitation of
     section 401(a)(17) of the Code, is reduced solely on account of the
     exclusion under the Base Plan of any deferrals by the employee under the
     Supplemental Savings Plan.

2.2. Exclusions. The following employees shall be excluded from participation in
the Plan:

     2.2.1 Non-Members of a Select Group of Management or Highly Compensated
     Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan or in any
     written communication, summary, resolution or document or oral
     communication, unless an individual is a member of a select group of
     management or highly compensated employees (as that expression is used in
     ERISA), the individual shall not be a Participant in this Plan, develop
     benefits under this Plan or be entitled to receive benefits under this Plan
     (either for the Participant or the Participant&#39;s survivors) except to the
     extent that the individual&#39;s benefits in Base Plan are reduced on account
     of Code section 415 limits.

     If a court of competent jurisdiction, any representative of the U.S.
     Department of Labor or any other governmental, regulatory or similar body
     makes any direct or indirect, formal or informal, determination that an
     individual is not a member of a select group of management or highly
     compensated employees (as that expression is used in ERISA), such
     individual shall not be (and shall not have ever been) a Participant in
     this Plan at any time except to the extent that the individual&#39;s benefits


                                       4




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     in Base Plan are reduced on account of Code section 415 limits. If any
     person not so defined has been erroneously treated as a Participant in this
     Plan, upon discovery of such error such person&#39;s erroneous participation
     shall immediately terminate ab initio and upon demand such person shall be
     obligated to reimburse Honeywell for all amounts erroneously paid to him or
     her.

     2.2.2 Participants in the Honeywell International Inc. Supplemental Pension
     Plan. An employee entitled to a supplemental benefit under the Honeywell
     International Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan shall not be a Participant in
     this Plan and shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Plan.

2.3. Duration. Any employee who has become a Participant in this Plan shall
continue as a Participant until all benefits due under this Plan have been paid
(or forfeited) without regard to whether he or she continues as a participant in
the Base Plan.

                                    BENEFITS

3.1. Participant Benefits.

     3.1.1 Basic Benefit. Commencing as of the Benefit Starting Date a
     Participant satisfying the participation requirements of Section 2.1.1
     shall receive a benefit in this Plan which shall be the excess, if any, of:

          (a)  the amount that would be payable under the formula and rules of
               the Base Plan (as the Base Plan exists on the date as of which
               such amount is determined) if determined:

               (i)   without regard to the benefit limitation under section 415
                     of the of the Code, and

               (ii)  without regard to the compensation limitation under section
                     401(a)(17) of the Code, and

               (iii) without regard to the exclusion from the definition of
                     Earnings under the Base Plan of deferred incentive payments
                     under Honeywell Corporate Executive Compensation Plan, the
                     AlliedSignal Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive
                     Employees (or any successor plans) or employee deferrals
                     under the Supplemental Savings Plan, over

          (b)  the amount actually paid from the Base Plan.

     3.1.2 Minimum Benefit. A Participant who only satisfies the participation
     requirements of Section 2.1.2 shall receive a benefit in this Plan
     commencing as of the Benefit Commencement Date which shall be the excess,
     if any, of:

          (a) the amount that would be payable under the formula and rules of
          the Base Plan (as the Base Plan exists on the date as of which such
          amount is determined, including, without limitation, the provisions
          excluding from earnings any deferred incentive awards paid under the
          Honeywell Corporate Executive Compensation Plan, the AlliedSignal Inc.
          Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees (or any successor
          plans), and the application of the benefit limitation under section
          415 of the Code and the compensation limitation of section 401(a)(17)
          of the Code) if determined without regard to the exclusion from the
          definition of Earnings under the Base Plan of any deferrals by the
          Participant under the Supplemental Savings Plan, over

          (b) the amount actually paid from the Base Plan.

     3.1.3 Limitation on Benefits. A Participant&#39;s benefit in this Plan may be
     limited in the manner and to the extent to which the Participant has agreed
     in


                                       6




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     writing. A Participant satisfying the eligibility requirements of the
     Honeywell International Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan shall not be
     eligible for any benefits under this Plan.

3.2. Survivor Benefit

     3.2.1. Death Before Benefits Commence. If a Participant dies before the
     commencement of benefit payments from this Plan, satisfies the eligibility
     requirements of Section 2.1.1 or 2.1.2 on the date of death, and is
     eligible for a pre-retirement survivor benefit in the Base Plan, a benefit
     shall be payable to the Participant&#39;s survivor commencing as of the last
     day of the month of the Participant&#39;s death or, if later, the last day of
     the month of the Participant&#39;s earliest Benefit Starting Date. The survivor
     shall be the individual, if any, that is entitled to the preretirement
     survivor benefit in the Base Plan. The benefit shall be the amount the
     survivor would have received under this Plan if the Participant had
     terminated employment on the day before death, had commenced benefit
     payments on the last day of the month of death or, if later, the last day
     of the month of the Participant&#39;s earliest Benefit Starting Date in the
     same form as the preretirement survivor benefit that is payable under the
     Base Plan, and had died immediately thereafter.

     3.2.2. Death After Benefits Commence. If a Participant dies after the
     commencement of benefit payments from this Plan, the benefit payable shall
     be unpaid installments of annuity, if any, which are to be continued for a
     joint annuitant or beneficiary under the form of payment elected by the
     Participant under Section 4.

3.3. Special 1993 Vesting. As specified in the Prior Plan Statement, accrued
benefits were determined and vested for certain employees as of specified dates
in 1993 and, to the extent a vested benefit was attributable to service after
December 31, 1983, but before January 1, 1994, the present value of that benefit
was treated as &#34;wages&#34; for such employee for purposes of the Federal Insurance
Contribution Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Act (FUTA). The amount of
the vested benefit of individuals who were named in the Prior Plan Statement and
have not commenced benefits in the Plan as of the Effective Date are specified
on Table II.

                                    SECTION 4
                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

4.1. Forms of Payment. Except as provided in Section 4.2 below, the payment
forms available to a Participant shall be a 100% Joint and Survivor Annuity, a
50% Joint and Survivor Annuity, a Single Life Annuity, and a 10 Year Period
Certain and Life Annuity, as those payment forms are defined in the Base Plan,
with the designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary that is effective for the
Participant in the Base Plan. The Participant&#39;s election of a payment form and
designation of a joint annuitant or beneficiary shall be made in the form and
manner prescribed by the Committee and may be revoked by the Participant at any
time prior to the Benefit Starting Date. A Participant who is married on the
Benefit Starting Date must obtain the written consent of the Participant&#39;s
spouse in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee to the election of any
form other than a 100% Joint and Survivor Annuity with the Participant&#39;s spouse
designated as the joint annuitant.

4.2. Lump Sum Payment.

     4.2.1. Election and Amount. A Participant may receive payment of benefits
     in the form of a single lump sum if the Participant makes an irrevocable
     election in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee. If the
     Participant is married when the election is made, the Participant&#39;s spouse
     must consent to the election in writing and acknowledge the effect of such
     election. An election shall not be considered made until it is actually
     received by the Committee and unless such actual receipt occurs prior to
     the Participant&#39;s death. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the
     present value of the Participant&#39;s benefit determined under Section 3.1
     using the interest rate and mortality assumptions set forth in Table I and
     if the election is made less than thirteen (13) months before the
     Participant&#39;s termination of employment for reasons other than death, the
     lump sum payment shall be reduced by 10% which shall be forfeited.

     4.2.2. Death Within 13 Month Period. If a Participant dies less than
     thirteen (13) months after making an election to receive a lump sum
     payment, payment to the Participant&#39;s survivor shall be made in the form of
     a single lump sum. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the present
     value of the survivor&#39;s benefit determined under Section 3.2.1 using the
     interest rate and mortality assumptions set forth in Table I.

     4.2.3. Acceleration of Benefits with Forfeiture. A Participant, survivor,
     joint annuitant or beneficiary who is receiving benefit payments under this
     Plan may at any time eject to receive the remaining benefit in a lump sum
     payment. The amount of the lump sum shall be the present value of the
     remaining benefit determined as of the last day of the month in which the
     election is received by the Committee using the interest rate and mortality
     assumptions set forth on Table I less 10% which shall be forfeited.

4.3. Timing. Actual distribution of benefits from the Plan shall begin on or as
soon as administratively feasible after the last day of the month in which the
Benefit Starting Date occurs; provided however that lump sum payments pursuant
to an election under


                                       8




&lt;PAGE&gt;


Section 4.2.3 shall be made on or as soon as administratively feasible after the
last day of the month following the month in which the request to accelerate
benefits is received by the Committee, and lump sum payments pursuant to Section
6.1 shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Plan
termination.

4.4. Change in Control.

     4.4.1. Immediate Vesting. In the event of a Change in Control as defined in
     this Section, each employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of
     Section 2.1.1 on the day before the Change in Control shall be immediately
     and fully vested in the benefit that would have been payable if the
     employee had terminated employment on the day before the Change in Control
     and in any additional benefit the employee accrues in this Plan following
     the Change in Control.

     4.4.2. Definition. For all purposes of this Plan, a &#34;Change in Control&#34;
     shall have occurred if:

          (a) any &#34;person&#34; as such term is used in section 13(d) and 14(d) of
          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#34;Exchange Act&#34;)
          (other than Honeywell Inc., any subsidiary of Honeywell Inc., any
          &#34;person&#34; (as herein defined) acting on behalf of Honeywell Inc. as
          underwriter pursuant to an offering who is temporarily holding
          securities in connection with such offering, any trustee or other
          fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of

          the stockholders of Honeywell Inc. in substantially the same
          proportions as their ownership of stock of Honeywell Inc.), is or

          Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, or securities of Honeywell Inc.
          representing thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power
          of Honeywell Inc.&#39;s then outstanding securities;

          (b) during any period of not more than two consecutive years (not
          including any period prior to the Effective Date), individuals who at
          the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of
          Honeywell Inc., and any new director (other than a director designated
          by a &#34;person&#34; who has entered into an agreement with Honeywell Inc. to
          effect a transaction described in Section 4.4.2 (a), (c) or (d)) whose
          election by the Board of Directors of Honeywell Inc. or nomination for
          election by Honeywell Inc.&#39;s stockholders was approved by a vote of at
          least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were
          directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or
          nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
          reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;

          (c) the stockholders of Honeywell Inc. approve a merger or
          consolidation of Honeywell Inc. with any other corporation, other than
          (i) a merger or consolidate which would result in the voting

          continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
          converted into

&lt;PAGE&gt;


          voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent

          Honeywell Inc. or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after
          such merger or consolidation; or (ii) a merger or consolidation

          Honeywell Inc.&#39;s then outstanding securities; or

          (d) the stockholders of Honeywell Inc. approve a plan of complete
          liquidation of Honeywell Inc. or an agreement for the sale or
          disposition of Honeywell International Inc. of all or substantially
          all of Honeywell Inc.&#39;s assets (or any transaction having a similar
          effect).

4.5. Taxes. AIl taxes which may be due with respect to any payments or benefits
under this Plan are the obligation of the Participant and not the obligation of
the Employer. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, if all
or a portion of a benefit in this Plan is determined to be includable in an
individuaI&#39;s gross income and subject to income tax at any time prior to the
time such benefit would otherwise be paid, that benefit or that portion of a
benefit shall be distributed to the individual. For this purpose, an amount is
determined to be includable in an individual&#39;s gross income upon the earliest
of: (a) a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service addressed to the
individual which is not appealed, (b) a final determination of by the United
States Tax Court or any other federal court affirming an IRS determination, or
(c) an opinion addressed to Honeywell International Inc. by the tax counsel for
Honeywell that, by reason of the Code, Treasury Regulations, published IRS
rulings, court decisions or other substantial precedent, the amount is subject
to federal income tax prior to payment. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions
of this Section 4.5, in the event that the Employer funds all or part of the
benefits of any Participant as permitted in Section 5.1, (x) that benefit or
portion of the benefit so funded shall not be distributed to that Participant if
such Participant and the amount of such Participant&#39;s benefit so funded is set
forth in Table III, and (y) the Committee shall provide for the distribution of
benefits in accordance with Section 4 and applicable law.

4.6. Incompetency. When the Committee determines that an individual to whom
benefits are payable is unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the
Committee may pay such individual&#39;s benefits to a duly appointed conservator or
other legal representative of such individual or, if no prior claim has been
made by such a conservator or legal representative, to a person or institution
entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disabled individual
if the Committee is satisfied that the payments will be used for the best
interest of such individual. Any payment made in accordance with this Section
shall constitute a complete discharge or any liability or obligation of the
Employer and Plan.

                                    SECTION 5
                                 GENERAL MATTERS

5.1. Funding. All benefits under this Plan shall be paid exclusively from the
general assets of Honeywell. No fund or trust shall be established apart from
the general assets of Honeywell for the purpose of this Plan and no assets or
property shall be segregated, pledged or set apart from the general assets of
Honeywell for the purposes of funding this Plan. Any person entitled to benefits
under this Plan shall be a general, unsecured creditor of Honeywell. The
foregoing shall not preclude the establishment by Honeywell of a &#34;rabbi trust&#34;.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Committee is authorized (but not
required) to cause Honeywell to fund all or a part of the benefits for such
Participant or Participants as it may select in its sole discretion from time to
time. The Committee is authorized to select, appoint and remove trustees, to
enter into, amend and terminate trust agreements, to create trust funds, to
cause Honeywell to make contributions to such trust funds in such amounts as the
Committee may determine from time to time and to take all other actions that it
may determine to be necessary or helpful in implementing the funding.

5.2. Status of Participant. A Participant shall have no right, title, or
interest in or to any investments which Honeywell may make to aid it in meeting
the obligations of this Plan. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action
taken pursuant to its provisions shall create or be construed to create a trust
of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between Honeywell and a Participant or
any beneficiary. Except to the extent benefits are funded for any Participant as
set forth in Table III, to the extent that any person acquires a right to
receive payments from Honeywell, such right shall be no greater than the right
of an unsecured creditor. The assets of any benefits funded for any Participant
as set forth in Section 5.1 and Table III shall not be assets of Honeywell or
any Employer and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor of Honeywell
or any Employer.

5.3. Spendthrift Provision. No Participant, surviving spouse, joint annuitant or
beneficiary shall have the power to transmit, assign, alienate, dispose of,
pledge or encumber any benefit payable under this Plan before its actual payment
to such person. Honeywell shall not recognize any such effort to convey any
interest under this Plan. No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject to
attachment, garnishment, execution following judgment or other legal process
before actual payment to such person.

5.4. No Employment Contract. This Plan shall not give any employee the right to
be retained in the employment of the Employer, shall not enlarge or diminish any
person&#39;s employment rights or rights or obligations under the Base Plan, and
shall not affect the right of the Employer to deal with any employees or
participants in employment respects, including, without limitation, their
hiring, discharge, compensation, and conditions of employment.

                                    SECTION 6
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

6.1. Amendment. The Committee (or its delegate) shall have the right to amend or
terminate the PIan at any time, for any reason and without notice to any
affected person; provided, however, that, except with respect to automatic lump
sum payments and interest rate assumptions or as otherwise agreed to by the
Participant, the Plan may not be amended in any manner that would adversely
affect the benefit which would have been payable to an employee if the employee
had terminated employment on the day before the amendment or that would reduce
the benefit that is being paid to any person at the time of the amendment. If
this Plan is terminated, each employee who satisfies the eligibility
requirements of Section 2 on the date the Plan is terminated and each
Participant, joint annuitant or beneficiary who is receiving benefits under this
Plan shall receive a lump sum payment of the accrued benefit or remaining
benefit, as applicable, in this Plan as soon as administratively feasible after
such Plan termination. The lump sum shall be the present value of the person&#39;s
accrued benefit or remaining benefit as of the date the Plan is terminated using
the interest rate and mortality assumptions set forth in Table I.

6.2. Change in Control. Notwithstanding Section 6.1, for a period that begins on
the date of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4) and ends on the last
day of the thirty-sixth month that begins after the month in which the Change in
Control occurs, the Plan may not be terminated or amended in any manner
whatsoever that would adversely affect the amount and form of benefits payable
under this Plan to an employee without the employee&#39;s consent.

6.3. Amendments to Base Plan. It is specifically contemplated that the Base Plan
will, from time to time, be amended and possibly terminated. All such amendments
and termination shall be given effect under this Plan as it is expressly
intended that this Plan shall not be restricted by the provisions of the Base
Plan as they exist on the Effective Date but shall be controlled by the
provisions of the Base Plan as of the date a benefit is determined under this
Plan.

                                    SECTION 7
                            DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIMS

7.1. Determinations. The Committee or any person to whom such authority has been
delegated pursuant to Section 8 shall interpret and administer the terms and
conditions of the Plan, decide all questions concerning the eligibility of any
persons to participate in the Plan, grant or deny benefits under the Plan,
construe any ambiguous provision of the Plan, correct any defect, supply any
omission, or reconcile any inconsistency as the Personnel Committee or its
delegatee, in its sole discretion, may determine. The determinations of the
Personnel Committee or any authorized person shall, subject only to the Plan&#39;s
claims procedures, be final and binding on all persons.

7.2. Claims Procedure.

     7.2.1. Original Claim. Any employee, former employee, joint or contingent
     annuitant or beneficiary of the Participant may file with the Committee a
     written claim for benefits under this Plan. Within sixty (60) days after
     the filing of such a claim, the Committee shall notify the claimant in
     writing whether his claim is upheld or denied in whole or in part or shall
     furnish the claimant a written notice describing specific special
     circumstances requiring a specified amount of additional time (but not more
     than one hundred twenty days from the date the claim was filed) to reach a
     decision on the claim. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the
     Committee shall state in writing:

          (a)  the specific reasons for the denial;

          (b)  the specific references to the pertinent provisions of this Plan
               on which the denial is based;

          (c)  a description of any additional material or information necessary
               for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why
               such material or information is necessary; and

          (d)  an explanation of the claims review procedure set forth in this
               section.

     7.2.2. Claims Review Procedure. Within sixty (60) days after receipt of
     notice that his or her claim has been denied in whole or in part, the
     claimant may file with the Committee a written request for a review and
     may, in conjunction therewith, submit written issues and comments. Within
     sixty (60) days after the filing of such a request for review, the
     Committee shall notify the claimant in writing whether, upon review, the
     claim was upheld or denied in whole or in part or shall furnish the
     claimant a written notice describing specific special circumstances
     requiring a specified amount of additional time (but not more than one
     hundred twenty days from the date the request for review was filed) to
     reach a decision on the request for review.


                                       13




&lt;PAGE&gt;


     7.2.3. General Rules.

            (a) No inquiry or question shall be deemed to be a claim or a
            request for a review of a denied claim unless made in accordance
            with the claims procedure. The Committee may require that any
            claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim
            be filed on forms to be furnished by the Committee upon request.

            (b) All decision on claims and on requests for a review of denied
            claims shall be made by the Committee.

            (c) The Committee may, in its discretion, hold one or more
            hearings on a claim or a request for a review of a denied claim.

            (d) Claimants may be represented by a lawyer or other
            representative (at their own expense), but the Committee reserves
            the right to require the claimant to furnish written
            authorization. A claimant&#39;s representative shall be entitled to
            receive copies of notices sent to the claimant.

            (e) The decision of the Committee on a claim and on a request for
            a review of a denied claim shall be served on the claimant in
            writing. If a decision or notice is not received by a claimant
            within the time specified, the claim or request for a review of a
            denied claim shall be deemed to have been denied.

            (f) Prior to filing a claim or a request for a review of a denied
            claim, the claimant or his representative shall have a reasonable
            opportunity to review a copy of this Plan statement and all other
            pertinent documents in the possession of Honeywell and the
            Committee.

                                    SECTION 8
                               PLAN ADMINISTRATION

8.1. Employer. Functions generally assigned to the Employer shall be discharged
by the officers of Honeywell or delegated and allocated as provided herein.
Honeywell may by action of the Committee, delegate or re-delegate and allocate
and reallocate to one or more persons or to a committee of persons jointly or
severally, and whether or not such persons are directors, officers or employees,
such functions assigned to the Employer hereunder as it may from time to time
deem advisable.

8.2. Committee. The general administration and operation of this Plan shall be
by the Committee, which shall consist of such members as may be determined and
appointed from time to time by the Honeywell&#39;s Board of Directors, and who shall
serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Committee may delegate or
re-delegate to one or more persons, jointly or severally, and whether or not
such persons are members of the Committee or employees of Honeywell, such
functions assigned to the Committee hereunder as it may from time to time deem
advisable.

8.3. Method of Executing Instruments. Information to be supplied or written
notices to be made or consents to be given by the Employer or the Committee, as
applicable, pursuant to any provision of this Plan may be signed in the name of
the Employer or the Committee by any officer or by any employee or any member of
any committee who has been authorized to make such certification and to give
such notices or consents.

8.4. Conflict of Interest. If any officer or employee of Honeywell, any member
of the Board of Directors of Honeywell or any member of the Committee to whom
authority has been delegated or re-delegated hereunder shall also be a
Participant in this Plan, he or she shall have no authority as such officer,
employee or member with respect to any matter specially affecting his or her
individual interest hereunder (as distinguished from the interests of all
Participants and or a broad class of Participants), all such authority being
reserved exclusively to the other officers, employees or members, as the case
may be, to the exclusion of such Participant, and such Participant shall act
only in his or her individual capacity in connection with any such matter.

8.5. Plan Administrator. The Committee shall be the administrator for purposes
of section 3(16)(A) of ERISA.

8.6. Construction. This Plan is intended to be a nonqualified deferred
compensation arrangement. The rules of section 401(a) et. seq. of the Code shall
not apply to this Plan. This plan is adopted with the understanding that except
as set forth in Table III it is in part an unfunded excess benefit plan within
the meaning of section 3(36) ERISA and is in part an unfunded plan maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group
of


                                       15




&lt;PAGE&gt;


management or highly compensated employees as provided in sections 201(2),
301(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. Each provision hereof shall be interpreted and
administered accordingly. This Plan shall not provide any benefits with respect
to any defined contribution plan. This Plan shall be construed to prevent the
duplication of benefits provided under any other plan or arrangement, whether
qualified or nonqualified, funded or unfunded, to the extent that such other
benefits are provided directly or indirectly by Honeywell.

The Committee (or its delegate) may determine that the portion of the Plan
providing funded benefits to Participants designated on this Table III shall be
separated from the remaining portion of this Plan as of December 20, 2000 (or
such later date as may be established by the Committee) and shall thereafter
constitute a separate plan, program or arrangement with terms and provisions
identical to this Plan. Benefits under such separate plan, program or
arrangement and this Plan shall be calculated to avoid duplication or omission
of benefits.

of any kind except for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.

all liabilities incurred by it hereunder as a consequence of such party&#39;s
action, and to indemnify the Escrow Agent and hold it harmless against any

                    and, as to Participants employed in Career Band 5 or above,

                    effect on the date of the Participant&#39;s Involuntary


                                       5




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                    Termination, prior to any reduction thereto, (b) such
                    continuation of life and medical benefits will cease on the
                    date similar benefits are provided the Participant by a
                    subsequent employer, and (c) the executive flex-perk
                    allowance will be continued during the entire severance pay
                    period, subject to 4.2(D).

              C)    Pension Service Continuation - Participants entitled to
                    benefits under the Plan shall become 100% vested in their
                    defined benefit pension plan benefits (all defined benefit
                    plans in which a Participant has accrued a benefit are
                    collectively referred to as the &#34;DB Plans&#34;). During their
                    Pay continuation period, Participants shall continue to be
                    credited with additional age and service credit for purposes
                    of benefit accrual (up to a maximum of twelve (12) months of
                    a Participant&#39;s Pay continuation period), vesting and
                    eligibility under the DB Plans in which they participate. At
                    the end of a Participant&#39;s Pay continuation period,
                    Participants shall immediately be credited with three (3)
                    years of age and service, respectively, for purposes of
                    benefit accruals, vesting and eligibility under the DB
                    Plans; provided, however, that such three (3) years of
                    additional age shall be credited only if such additional age
                    credits would (either alone or in conjunction with a bridge
                    leave of absence) enable a Participant to be eligible for
                    immediate payment of an early or normal retirement benefit
                    under the applicable defined benefit pension plan in which
                    the Participant participates. The normal policy for
                    qualifying bridge leaves of absence, as reflected in the
                    applicable defined benefit pension plan in which the
                    Participant participates, shall remain applicable
                    thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant
                    shall be eligible for the additional three (3) years of age
                    and service credit under the DB Plans only if such
                    Participant executes a general release of claims against
                    Honeywell International Inc., its subsidiaries and
                    affiliates in a form and manner prescribed by the Plan
                    Administrator.

              D)    If any payment to a Participant made pursuant to the terms
                    of this Plan (including payments from any benefit or
                    compensation plan or program sponsored or funded by
                    Honeywell International Inc. but excluding payments and
                    benefits provided upon a change in control under the
                    AlliedSignal Severance Plan for Senior Executives, Honeywell
                    Inc. Tier 1A and Tier 1B agreements, and any similar plan or
                    arrangement under which participants have their benefits
                    increased because of taxes under Section 4999 of the Code)
                    is determined to be an &#34;excess parachute payment&#34; within the
                    meaning of Section 280G or any successor or substitute
                    provision of the Code, with the effect that either the
                    Participant is liable for the payment of the tax described
                    in Section 4999 or any successor or substitute provision of
                    the Code (hereafter the &#34;Section 4999 tax&#34;) or Honeywell
                    International Inc. has withheld the amount of the Section
                    4999 tax, an additional benefit shall be paid pursuant to
                    this Plan


                                       6




&lt;PAGE&gt;


                    to such affected Participant, in an amount, which when added
                    to all payments constituting &#34;parachute payments&#34; for
                    purposes of Section 280G or any successor or substitute
                    provision of the Code, is sufficient to cause the remainder
                    of (i) the sum of the &#34;parachute payments&#34;, including any
                    payments made pursuant to this subparagraph D), less (ii)
                    the amount of all state, local and federal income taxes and
                    the Section 4999 tax attributable to such payments and
                    penalties and interest on any amount of Section 4999 tax,
                    other than penalties and interest on any amount of Section
                    4999 tax with respect to which such payment was paid to the
                    Participant on or before the due date of the Participant&#39;s
                    federal income tax return on which such Section 4999 tax
                    should have been paid, to be equal to the remainder of (iii)
                    sum of the &#34;parachute payments&#34;, excluding any payments made
                    pursuant to this subparagraph D), less (iv) the amount of
                    all state, local and federal income taxes attributable to
                    such payments determined as though the Section 4999 tax and
                    penalties and interest on any amount of Section 4999 tax,
                    other than penalties and interest on any amount of Section
                    4999 tax with respect to which a payment made pursuant to
                    this subparagraph D) was paid to the Participant on or
                    before the due date of the Participant&#39;s federal income tax
                    return on which such Section 4999 tax should have been paid,
                    did not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments to be
                    made pursuant to this subparagraph D), when added to
                    benefits provided under Section 4.2.B)(c), shall not in the
                    aggregate exceed three million dollars ($3,000,000) or such
                    greater amount as approved by Honeywell International Inc.
                    or its successor. In the event such payments exceed the
                    limitation described above, the designation of the type and
                    order of such payments to be reduced hereunder shall be made
                    by the Plan Administrator in his sole discretion. In such
                    case, a Participant shall, to the extent otherwise allowable
                    by law, be entitled to waive all or any portion of his or
                    her right to any benefit triggered by a Change in Control in
                    order to avoid the imposition of any tax under Section 4999
                    of the Code or any successor or substitute provision of the
                    Code.

4.3          Benefit Limitations

              To avoid duplication of benefits, the amount of any similar
              benefits under this Plan shall be offset and reduced by the amount
              of any similar benefit provided the Participant under other
              severance plans sponsored by Honeywell International Inc. for
              which the Participant may be eligible, regardless of whether the
              payments under this Plan are made at an earlier or a later date
              than payments under a similar plan would have been made. In
              addition, notwithstanding any plan provisions to the contrary, to
              the extent a Participant who was a former employee of Honeywell
              Inc. would be eligible for benefits under both this Plan and
              another severance plan sponsored by Honeywell Inc., such
              Participant shall only be entitled to benefits


                                       7




&lt;PAGE&gt;

              under this Plan to the extent such Participant waives his or her
              rights to benefits under such other severance plan.

Article V     Administration

5.1           Plan Administrator

              Prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, Honeywell
              International Inc.&#39;s Vice President-Worldwide Human Resources
              shall be the Plan Administrator within the meaning of ERISA
              Section 3(16)(A), and the named fiduciary within the meaning of
              ERISA Section 402. In the event of an impending Change in Control,
              Honeywell International Inc.&#39;s Vice President-Worldwide Human
              Resources shall appoint a person independent of Honeywell
              International Inc. or persons operating under its control or on
              its behalf (hereafter, the &#34;Corporation&#34;) to be the new Plan
              Administrator effective upon the occurrence of a Change in Control
              and the Vice President-Worldwide Human Resources shall immediately
              provide to the new Plan Administrator such information with
              respect to each Participant as shall be necessary to enable the
              new Plan Administrator to determine the amount of any benefit
              which is then or may thereafter become payable to such
              Participant.

5.2           Powers and Duties of Plan Administrator.

              Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Plan
              Administrator shall have the full discretionary power and
              authority to (i) determine the amount and timing of any benefit
              payable under the Plan, (ii) construe and interpret the Plan
              (including, without limitation, supplying omissions from,
              correcting deficiencies in, or resolving inconsistencies or
              ambiguities in, the language of the Plan), (iii) determine all
              questions of fact arising under the Plan, including questions as
              to eligibility for and the amount of benefits, (iv) establish such
              rules and regulations (consistent with the terms of the Plan) as
              it deems necessary or appropriate for administration of the Plan,
              (v) delegate responsibilities to others to assist it in
              administering the Plan, and (vi) perform all other acts it
              believes reasonable and proper in connection with the
              administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall be
              entitled to rely on the records of the Corporation in determining
              any Participant&#39;s entitlement to and the amount of benefits
              payable under the Plan.

5.3           Benefit Claims and Appeals.

              Any request or claim for Plan benefits shall be deemed to be filed
              when a written request is made by the claimant or the claimant&#39;s
              authorized representative which is reasonably calculated to bring
              the claim to the attention of the Plan Administrator.


                                       8




&lt;PAGE&gt;

                  The Plan Administrator shall provide notice in writing to any
                  claimant when a claim for benefits under the Plan has been
                  denied in whole or in part. Such notice shall be provided
                  within 90 days of the receipt by the Plan Administrator of the
                  claimant&#39;s claim or, if special circumstances require, and the
                  claimant is so notified in writing, within 180 days of the
                  receipt by the Plan Administrator of the claimant&#39;s claim. The
                  notice shall be written in a manner calculated to be
                  understood by the claimant and shall:

                         (i)     set forth the specific reasons for the denial
                                 of benefits;

                         (ii)    contain specific references to Plan provisions
                                 relative to the denial;

                         (iii)   describe any material and information, if any,
                                 necessary for the claim for benefits to be
                                 allowed, that had been requested, but not
                                 received by the Plan Administrator; and

                         (iv)    advise the claimant that any appeal of the Plan
                                 Administrator&#39;s adverse determination must be
                                 made in writing to the Plan Administrator
                                 within 60 days after receipt of the initial
                                 denial notification, and must set forth the
                                 facts upon which the appeal is based.

              If notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished within the
              time periods set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied and
              the claimant shall be permitted to proceed to the review
              procedures set forth below. If the claimant fails to appeal the
              Plan Administrator&#39;s denial of benefits in writing and within 60
              days after receipt by the claimant of written notification of
              denial of the claim (or within 60 days after a deemed denial of
              the claim), the Plan Administrator&#39;s determination shall become
              final and conclusive.

              If the claimant appeals the Plan Administrator&#39;s denial of
              benefits in a timely fashion, the Plan Administrator shall
              re-examine all issues relevant to the original denial of benefits.
              Any such claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may
              review any pertinent documents, as determined by the Plan
              Administrator, and submit in writing any issues or comments to be
              addressed on appeal.

              The Plan Administrator shall advise the claimant and such
              individual&#39;s representative of its decision, which shall be
              written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant,
              and include specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions
              on which the decision is based. Such response shall be made within
              60 days of receipt of the written appeal, unless special
              circumstances require an extension of such 60-day period for not
              more than an additional 60 days. Where such extension is

              The plan year shall be the calendar year.

5.5           Indemnification.

              To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall indemnify
              the Plan Administrator from all claims for liability, loss, or
              damage (including payment of expenses in connection with defense
              against such claims) arising from any act or failure to act in
              connection with the Plan.

Article VI    Unfunded Obligation.

6.1           All benefits payable under this Plan shall constitute an unfunded
              obligation of the Corporation. Payments shall be made, as due,
              from the general funds of Corporation. This Plan shall constitute
              solely an unsecured promise by the Corporation to pay severance
              benefits to participants to the extent provided herein.

Article VII   Inalienability of Benefits.

7.1           No Participant shall have the power to transfer, assign,
              anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber any rights or any
              amounts payable under this Plan; nor shall any such rights or
              amounts payable under this Plan be subject to seizure, attachment,
              execution, garnishment or other legal or equitable process, or for
              the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate
              maintenance, or be transferable by operation of law in the event
              of bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. In the event a person who
              is receiving or is entitled to receive benefits under the Plan
              attempts to assign, transfer or dispose of such right, or if an
              attempt is made to subject such right to such process, such
              assignment, transfer or disposition shall be null and void.
              Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall prevent a Participant from
              waiving all or any portion of any benefit triggered by a Change in
              Control in accordance with Section 4.2.D).

Article VIII  Withholding

8.1           The Corporation shall have the right to withhold any taxes
              required to be withheld with respect to any payments due under
              this Plan.

9.1           Plan Amendments - The Board of Directors reserves the right to
              amend the Plan from time to time prior to a Change in Control.
              However, no amendment shall


                                       10




&lt;PAGE&gt;


              reduce any benefit being paid or then payable to a Participant.
              Further, no amendment shall reduce the benefits provided by the
              Plan to persons who were Participants as of the date of such
              amendment or adversely affect in any manner the rights of persons
              who were Participants as of the date of such amendment to benefits
              provided under this Plan. This Plan may not be amended or
              terminated after a Change in Control; provided, however, the Plan
              may be amended if the purpose of the amendment is to increase
              benefits hereunder.

              Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Vice
              President-Worldwide Human Resources shall be permitted to amend
              the Plan to reflect changes in Honeywell International Inc.&#39;s
              organization; provided, however, that no such amendment (i) shall
              increase or decrease benefits under the Plan, or (ii) increase the
              total number of Participants by more than five percent (5%) during
              any twelve month period.

9.2           Plan Termination - The Board of Directors reserves the right to
              terminate the Plan. However, such termination shall not adversely
              affect the rights of persons who were Participants as of the date
              of such termination.

Article X.    Plan Not a Contract of Employment; Honeywell International Inc.&#39;s
              Policies Control.

10.1          Nothing contained in this Plan shall give an employee the right to
              be retained in the employment of Honeywell International Inc..
              This Plan is not a contract of employment between Honeywell
              International Inc. and any employee. Any dispute involving issues
              of employment, other than claims for benefits under this Plan,
              shall be governed by the appropriate employment dispute resolution
              policies and procedures of Honeywell International Inc..

Article XI        Action by the Honeywell International Inc.

11.1          Unless expressly indicated to the contrary herein, any action
              required to be taken by Honeywell International Inc. may be taken
              by action of its Board of Directors or by any appropriate officer
              or officers traditionally responsible for such determination or
              actions, or such other individual or individuals as may be
              designated by the board of directors or any such officer.

Article XII   Governing Law

12.1          The Plan is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of

&lt;PAGE&gt;

13.1          If any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for
              any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
              remaining parts of this Plan, but this Plan shall be construed and
              enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been
              included herein.

     The Aerospace-related businesses have organized their marketing, sales,
service, technical support, repair and overhaul and distribution capabilities
into a single, dedicated point of contact for its customers -- the Marketing,
Sales &amp; Service (MS&amp;S) unit.
 
     Additionally, the environmental catalysts business, a joint-venture with
the General Motors Corporation, is a major worldwide supplier of catalysts used
in catalytic converters for automobiles.
 
GENERAL
 
     The Aerospace-related businesses serve key commercial and military
components of the aviation, defense and space markets with a broad array of
systems, subsystems, components and services. They design, develop, manufacture,
market and service hundreds of products found on all types of aircraft, from
single-piston engine aircraft, business aircraft and wide-bodied &#39;jumbos&#39; flown
by the world&#39;s commercial airlines, to trainers, transports, bombers, fighters
and helicopters used by the U.S.
 
                                       9
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
and other countries for national defense. The Company&#39;s global business consists
primarily of original equipment (OE) sales and an extensive aftermarket
business, including spare parts, maintenance and repair, and retrofitting.
Worldwide customers include the U.S. and foreign governments, all of the major
airframe and engine manufacturers, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus
Industrie, Aero International (Regional), Raytheon, Israeli Aircraft Industries,
Northrop Grumman, British Aerospace, Cessna, Fairchild/Dornier, Dassault,
Gulfstream, Bombardier, Rockwell International, Pratt &amp; Whitney, General
Electric and Rolls-Royce, as well as the world&#39;s leading airlines and business
aircraft and general aviation aircraft operators, and dealers and distributors
of general aviation products. The Company also provides field engineering
management and technical support services to Boeing, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the U.S.
Department of Energy, other federal civilian agencies as well as state and local
governments and other commercial entities.
 
     The Company is affected by U.S. Government budget constraints for defense
and space programs as well as the level of production of commercial, business
and general aviation aircraft which are impacted by business cycles and world
economic conditions. Growth in the Company&#39;s commercial business for aerospace
products is expected, over the long term, to help mitigate the reductions in
U.S. defense spending. Moreover, sales of aerospace products are not dependent
on any one key defense program or commercial customer.
 
     In 1997, world defense spending stabilized after declining in prior years.
Meanwhile, substantial improvement was seen in the commercial aircraft market,
with build rates for large airlines at near record levels. This level of
commercial activity is expected to continue in 1998. Regional airlines
experienced strong traffic growth and new regional aircraft orders were also
higher in 1997. The high-end business aviation market experienced significant
growth and the commercial aftermarket spare parts and repair and overhaul
business also showed strong improvement during 1997.
 
     The Automotive businesses design, engineer, manufacture and distribute
systems and components for worldwide vehicle manufacturers and aftermarket
customers. As a result of recent acquisitions and divestitures, however, the
Company&#39;s automotive businesses are shifting their focus to the worldwide
aftermarket. The Automotive businesses market and distribute popular
customer-branded products as well as private-label brands through warehouse
distributors, mass merchandisers and parts retailers worldwide.
 
     In 1997 and 1996, excluding the impact of the divested safety restraints
and braking businesses, aftermarket sales, including OES sales, accounted for
62% and 63%, respectively, of the total sales of the Automotive businesses and
worldwide passenger car and truck OE sales accounted for the balance. In 1997
and 1996, Automotive-related operations outside the U.S. accounted for $1,384
and $1,332 million, or 46% and 49%, respectively, of total Automotive related
sales.
 
     The Engineered Materials product area has three business units: Polymers,
Specialty Chemicals and Electronic Materials. The Engineered Materials
businesses manufacture chemicals, fibers, plastics and advanced materials with
applications for numerous industries, including electronics, automotive,
carpeting, refrigeration, construction, computers and utilities.
 
     The Polymers business is comprised of fibers, chemicals and plastic resin.
It operates caprolactam, ammonium sulfate and phenol plants. Polymers&#39; market
positions include nylon fiber for carpets and textiles, polyester fiber for
industrial applications and intermediate chemicals. Polymers also makes
Spectra&#39;r&#39; fiber used in armor and sporting goods.
 
     The Specialty Chemicals business manufactures fluorine, hydrofluoric acid
and polyethylene wax products. Specialty Chemicals serves the refrigeration and
air conditioning, insulating foams, sterilization, hydrofluoric acid,
pharmaceutical, agricultural, semiconductor, electronics, polymers, coatings and
sealants and nuclear markets with key specialty and fine chemicals. Included in
Specialty Chemicals is the Company&#39;s UOP joint venture with Union Carbide, a
global leader in process technology for the petroleum industry. The integration
of the German chemical company Riedel-de Haen into Specialty Chemicals in 1996
significantly increased Specialty Chemicals&#39; role as a global supplier of
pharmaceutical intermediates.
 
                                       10
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
     The Electronic Materials business includes laminate systems, materials used
in the production of printed wiring boards, and advanced microelectronic
materials which serves the semiconductor fabrication industry. Also included in
this unit is the amorphous metals business which makes specialty metals for
transformers.
 
     The Company continuously assesses the relative strength of its portfolio of
businesses as to strategic fit, market position and profit contribution in order
to upgrade its combined portfolio and identify operating units that will most
benefit from increased investment. The Company considers acquisition candidates
that will further its strategic plan and strengthen its existing core
businesses. The Company also identifies operating units that do not fit into its
long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability
or growth potential. These operating units are considered for potential
divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning action.
 
U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 
     Aerospace-related sales to the U.S. Government, acting through its various
departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $1,851
million for 1997 and $1,833 million for 1996, which includes sales to the DoD of
$1,338 million in 1997 and $1,237 million in 1996. Approximately 59% and 55% of
sales to the U.S. Government in 1997 and 1996, respectively, were made under
fixed-price contracts in which the Company agrees to perform a contract for a
fixed price and retains for itself any benefits of cost savings or must bear the
burden of cost overruns.
 
     In addition to normal business risks, companies engaged in supplying
military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual
risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and
regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political
developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs
and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, constant necessity for design
improvements, intense competition for available U.S. Government business
necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development,
difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and
highly sophisticated technical work and other factors characteristic of the
industry. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts,
particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of
contract prices.
 
     The Company, as are other government contractors, is subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations. Although such regulations provide that a contractor may be
suspended or debarred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the outcome of pending government investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty, management is not currently aware of any such investigations that it
expects will have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the
Company carries out proactive compliance programs focused on areas of potential
exposure.
 
BACKLOG
 
     Orders for certain aerospace-related products sold to general and
commercial aviation customers mainly consist of relatively short-term and
frequently renewed commitments. Government procurement agencies generally issue
contracts covering relatively long periods of time. Total backlog for
aerospace-related products and services for both government and commercial
contracts was $5,087 million at December 31, 1997 and $4,514 million at December
31, 1996 of which U.S. and foreign government orders were $1,908 million and
$1,906 million for the respective years. The Company anticipates that
approximately $4,247 million of the total 1997 backlog will be filled during
1998.
 
     Backlog information may not be an accurate indicator of future sales.
Government contracts and, in general, subcontracts thereunder are terminable, in
whole or in part, for default or for convenience by the government or the higher
level contractor if deemed in their best interest. Upon termination for
convenience, the contractor is normally entitled to reimbursement for allowable
costs and to an allowance for profit. However, if the contract is terminated
because of the contractor&#39;s default, the
 
                                       11
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
contractor may not recover all of its costs and may be liable for any excess
costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another
source.
 
     In addition to the right of the government to terminate, government
contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional
appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis even
though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the
outset of a program, the prime contract is usually partially funded and
additional funds are normally only appropriated to the contract by Congress in
future years. Fixed-price subcontracts are normally fully funded, but are
subject to convenience termination if the prime contract is not funded.
 
     In addition, changes in the general economic environment and the financial
condition of the airline industry may result in commercial customer requests for
rescheduling, reduction or cancellation of firm contractual orders.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     In June 1997, the Company acquired Prestone Products Corporation (Prestone)
for approximately $400 million, including assumed liabilities. Prestone is a
supplier of premium car care products and has annual sales of approximately $300
million. In July 1997, the Company acquired Grimes Aerospace Company (Grimes), a
manufacturer of exterior and interior aircraft lighting systems, for
approximately $475 million, including assumed liabilities. Grimes, which has
annual sales of approximately $230 million, also manufactures aircraft engine
components such as valves and heat exchangers, as well as electronic systems,
including flight warning computers and active matrix liquid crystal displays. In
October 1997, the Company acquired Astor Holdings, Inc. (Astor) for
approximately $370 million, including assumed liabilities. Astor, a producer of
value-added, wax-based processing aids, sealants and adhesives, has annual sales
of approximately $300 million. In November 1997, the Company acquired Holt Lloyd
Group Ltd. for approximately $150 million. Holt Lloyd is a supplier of car care
products primarily in Europe and Asia and has annual sales of approximately $150
million. In January 1998, the Company also acquired the Hardware Group and
PacAero unit of Banner Aerospace, distributors of aircraft hardware, for
approximately $350 million. The acquired operations have annual sales of about
$250 million, principally to commercial air transport and general aviation
customers. The Company also made several smaller acquisitions in 1997.
 
     To speed delivery of aftermarket products, the Company formed strategic
alliances in 1997 to streamline the Company&#39;s distribution processes. UPS
Worldwide Logistics distributes the Company&#39;s automotive aftermarket products to
customer locations across North America and Caterpillar Logistics Services
directs the global distribution of spare parts used in the repair and overhaul
of the Company&#39;s aerospace products.
 
     In October 1997, the Company completed the sale of its automotive safety
restraints business to Breed Technologies for $710 million in cash, subject to
post-closing adjustments. The safety restraints business had 1996 net sales and
income from operations of $940 and $70 million, respectively, from the sale of
seat belts and air bags. In the first quarter of 1998, the Company expects to
complete the sale of its underwater detection systems business to L-3
Communications Corporation for $70 million in cash, subject to post-closing
adjustments. The ocean systems unit had annual revenues of about $70 million.
During 1997, the Company also sold certain non-strategic businesses and other
assets.
 
     In April 1996, the Company sold a major component of its worldwide braking
business to Robert Bosch GmbH, a privately held German company, for $1.5 billion
in cash, subject to certain post-closing
 
                                       12
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
adjustments which were finalized in October 1997. Included in the sale were the
worldwide light-vehicle and medium-heavy truck hydraulic braking and ABS
businesses. These businesses had 1995 net sales of $2.0 billion.
 
     In 1997, the Company eliminated its three sector offices, consolidated its
automotive products and avionics groups and repositioned some of its businesses.
 
     The Company has recognized the need to ensure that its computer operations
and operating systems will not be adversely affected by the upcoming calendar
year 2000 and is cognizant of the time sensitive nature of the problem. The
Company has assessed how it may be impacted by Year 2000 and has formulated and
commenced implementation of a comprehensive plan to address known issues as they
relate to its information systems. The plan, as it relates to information
systems, involves a combination of software modification, upgrades and
replacement. The Company estimates that the cost of Year 2000 compliance for its
information systems will not have a material adverse effect on the future
consolidated results of operations of the Company. The Company is not yet able
to estimate the cost for Year 2000 compliance with respect to production
systems, products, customers and suppliers; however, based on a preliminary
review, management does not expect that such costs will have a material adverse
effect on the future consolidated results of operations of the Company.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The Company encounters substantial competition, in each of its product
areas, with businesses producing the same or similar products or with businesses
producing different products designed for the same uses. Such competition is
expected to continue both in the U.S. and in global markets. Depending on the
particular market involved, the Company&#39;s businesses compete on a variety of
factors, such as price, quality, delivery, customer service, performance,
product innovation and product recognition. Other competitive factors for
certain products include breadth of product line, research and development
efforts and technical and managerial capability. While the Company&#39;s competitive
position varies among its products, the Company believes it is a significant
factor in each of its major product classes.
 
     Aerospace-related products and services are sold in competition with those
of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial
resources and significant technological capabilities. The Automotive-related
products are sold in competition with other independent suppliers or with the
captive component divisions of the vehicle manufacturers. Engineered
materials-related businesses are aligned around markets, customers and common
technologies. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important
competitive factors in the market and there is considerable price competition.
 
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 
     The Company and affiliated companies are engaged in manufacturing, sales
and/or research and development mainly in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia and
Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to
the Company&#39;s operations. U.S. exports comprised 17% of total Company sales in
both 1997 and 1996 and foreign manufactured products and services were 22% and
23% of total Company sales in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
     The Company&#39;s international operations, including U.S. exports, are
potentially subject to a number of unique risks and limitations, including:
fluctuations in currency value; exchange control regulations; wage and price
controls; employment regulations; effects of foreign investment laws; import and
trade restrictions, including embargoes; and governmental instability.
 
     The Aerospace-related international operations consist primarily of
exporting U.S. manufactured products and systems, performance of services that
include operating aircraft repair and overhaul facilities, and licensing
activities. The principal manufacturing facility outside of the U.S. is in
Canada.
 
     Automotive-related foreign operations are located in Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,
South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom. Distribution and marketing are
conducted in these and numerous other countries as well. Automotive
 
                                       13
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
related operations outside the U.S. are conducted through various foreign
companies in which it has interests ranging from minor to complete control.
International operations also include the exporting of U.S. manufactured
products and licensing activities. Internationally, products are marketed under
the Bendix, Fram, Autolite and Garrett trademarks.
 
     Regarding Engineered Materials, Polymer&#39;s foreign operations are located in
Germany, France and China; Specialty Chemicals&#39; manufacturing facilities are
located in Germany, Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands and Electronic Materials
maintains facilities in Germany and Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore
and China.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     The principal raw materials used by the Company&#39;s businesses include:
Aerospace businesses -- carbon fiber; electronic, optical and mechanical
component parts and assemblies; electronic and electromechanical devices and
metallic products; Automotive businesses -- castings, forgings, steel and bar
stock, copper, aluminum, platinum and titanium and Engineered Materials
businesses -- cumene, natural gas, sulfur, terephthalic acid, ethylene and
ethylene glycol, fluorspar, HF, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, nylon resins,
fiberglass, copper foil, platinum, rhodium, polyester chips, lubricating oil
by-products, butylrubber and coal tar pitch. The Company is producing virtually
all of its HF and nylon resin requirements. The principal raw materials used in
the Company&#39;s operations are generally readily available. Major requirements for
key raw materials and fuels are typically purchased pursuant to multi-year
contracts. The Company is not dependent on any one supplier for a material
amount of its raw material or fuel requirements, however, the Company is highly
dependent on its suppliers and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to
its customers, and many major components and product equipment items are
procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and
foreign companies. The Company maintains a qualification and performance
surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third
parties. The Company believes that sources of supply for raw materials and
components are generally adequate, however, temporary shortages may occur from
time to time.
 
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 
     The Company owns approximately 9,060 patents or patent applications and is
licensed under other patents covering certain of its products and processes. It
believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under such patents and licenses are
generally important to its operations, but does not consider that any patent or
patent license agreement or group of them related to a specific process or
product is of material importance in relation to the Company&#39;s total business.
 
     The Company also has registered trademarks for a number of its products.
Some of the more significant trademarks include: AiResearch, Anso, Autolite,
Bendix, Bendix/King, Capron, Fram, Garrett, Genetron, King, Prestone and Norplex
Oak.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company&#39;s research activities are directed toward the discovery and
development of new products and processes, improvements in existing products and
processes, and the development of new uses of existing products.
 
     Research and development expense totaled $349, $345 and $353 million in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S.
Government) research and development activities amounted to an additional $597,
$536 and $536 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
     The Company is subject to various federal, state and local requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment. It is the Company&#39;s policy to comply with
these requirements and the Company believes that, as a general matter, its
policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable
risk of
 
                                       14
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with
its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in certain
operations and products of the Company, as it is with other companies engaged in
similar businesses.
 
     The Company is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use or
disposal of many substances which are classified as hazardous or toxic by one or
more regulatory agencies. The Company believes that, as a general matter, its
handling, manufacture, use and disposal of such substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future
knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect
substances in the environment, increasingly strict environmental laws and
standards and enforcement policies thereunder, could bring into question the
Company&#39;s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of such substances.
 
     Among other environmental requirements, the Company is subject to the
federal superfund law, and similar state laws, under which the Company has been
designated as a potentially responsible party which may be liable for cleanup
costs associated with various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s superfund priority list. Although, under
some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a
responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the
cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other
responsible parties, the Company has not had to bear significantly more than its
proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.
 
     Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities at existing
operations were $69 million in 1997. The Company estimates that during each of
the years 1998 and 1999 such capital expenditures will be in the $70 to $75
million range. In addition to capital expenditures, the Company has incurred and
will continue to incur operating costs in connection with such facilities.
 
     Reference is made to Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis at page 21 of the
Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report to shareowners, incorporated herein by reference,
for further information regarding environmental matters.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The Company had an aggregate of 70,500 salaried and hourly employees at
December 31, 1997. Approximately 51,900 were located in the United States, and,
of these employees, about 25% were unionized employees represented by various
local or national unions.
 
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
 
     The Company has 356 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories,
sales offices and other facilities. The plants are generally located to serve
large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor
pools. The properties are generally maintained in good operating condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with government spending and other business
conditions; however, no major operating facility is significantly idle. The
facilities, together with planned expansions, are expected to meet the Company&#39;s
needs for the foreseeable future. The Company owns or leases warehouses,
railroad cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The first and second paragraphs of Note 21 (Commitments and Contingencies)
of Notes to Financial Statements at page 36 of the Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report
to shareowners are incorporated herein by reference.
 
     On September 27, 1997 the Company asked the United States District Court
for the Northern District of New York to resolve a dispute over whether the
Company was late in delivering a mercury modeling report to the State of New
York. The report was delivered pursuant to a consent decree between the Company
and the State addressing a remedial investigation of the Onondaga Lake system
where the Company had operations prior to 1987. On December 19, 1997, the Court
ruled that the State had properly established a deadline for the report of April
15, 1997, and that a $191,000 stipulated penalty was payable under the consent
decree because the report had been delivered 58 days after the deadline.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

     &#39;Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis&#39; on pages 19 through 25 of the
Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report to shareowners is incorporated herein by reference.
 
     This Report contains, or incorporates by reference, certain statements that
may be deemed &#39;forward-looking statements&#39; within the meaning of Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of
historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the
Company or management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will
or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are
based upon certain
 
                                       17
 

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
assumptions and assessments made by management of the Company in light of its
experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected
future developments and other factors it believes to be appropriate. The
forward-looking statements included in this Report are also subject to a number
of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic,
competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company&#39;s
operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results,
developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such
forward-looking statements.
 
ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
     The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of
operations and financial condition. The Company seeks to minimize the risks from
these interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through its
regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through
the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use financial
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any
leveraged financial instruments.
 
     A discussion of the Company&#39;s accounting policies for financial instruments
is included in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) of Notes to
Financial Statements at page 29 of the Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report to
shareowners, and such information is incorporated herein by reference.
Additional disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in Note 17
(Financial Instruments) of Notes to Financial Statements at pages 34 and 35 of
the Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report to shareowners, and such information is
incorporated herein by reference.
 
     The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the
exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company&#39;s
principal currency exposures relate to the French franc, the German deutsche
mark and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. The Company&#39;s exposure to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from intercompany loans
utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries, receivables, payables and firm
commitments arising from international transactions. The Company attempts to
have all such transaction exposures hedged with internal natural offsets to the
fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted,
through derivative financial instruments with third parties using forward or
option agreements. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge the Company&#39;s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for
the translated U.S. dollar value of net income of a number of foreign
subsidiaries. Forward and option agreements used to hedge net income are marked
to market and recognized immediately in income.
 
     The Company utilizes both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as described in
Note 15 (Long-term Debt and Credit Agreement) of Notes to Financial Statements
at page 33 of the Company&#39;s 1997 Annual Report to shareowners, and such
information is incorporated herein by reference. The Company uses interest rate
swaps to manage the Company&#39;s exposure to interest rate movements and reduce
borrowing costs.
 
     The Company also maintains debt investments classified as
available-for-sale and carried at their quoted market value. These short-term
investments result from excess cash on hand.
 
     The Company manages market risk by restricting the use of derivative
financial instruments to hedging activities and by limiting potential interest
and currency rate exposures to amounts that are not material to the Company&#39;s
consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The Company also has
procedures to monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value of its
long-term debt, short-term debt investments and other financial instruments,
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency rates. These
procedures include the use of sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of
interest rate and currency rate changes on future cash flows and fair values.
The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest
rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate 1% point increase
in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value
for foreign exchange sensitive instruments based on a 10% increase in U.S.
dollar per local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31,
1997 (dollars in millions):

the estimated changes in fair value resulting from the Company&#39;s sensitivity
analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse
market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from
these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial
markets. The analysis methods used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk
discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses.

Article I - Purpose

                Effective November 20, 1975, Allied Corporation adopted the
Allied Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives and Key
Employees. Such plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 as the
AlliedSignal Supplemental Pension Plan (the &#34;Plan&#34;).

                The purpose of the Plan is to provide retired participants and
their joint annuitants and beneficiaries under the Pension Plan with the amount
of retirement income that is not provided under the Pension Plan because the
participant deferred compensation under one or more nonqualified deferred
compensation plans of AlliedSignal, including the Incentive Plan, the
Supplemental Savings Plans and the Salary Deferral Plan or, by reason of the
limits imposed by Section 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code. The Plan is also
intended to cover any contractual obligation Allied has to pay pension benefits
which cannot be provided under the provisions of the Pension Plan.

                Except to the extent otherwise indicated, and to the extent
otherwise inappropriate, the Pension Plan and the provisions thereof are hereby
incorporated by reference.

                      provided under the terms of the contractual agreement.


Article IV - Supplemental Benefit

4.01            Payment of Supplemental Benefit

                (a)   Supplemental Benefits shall be payable directly to such
                      participant, or such participant&#39;s joint annuitant or
                      beneficiary, as applicable, from the general assets of
                      AlliedSignal and AlliedSignal shall not be under any
                      obligation to set aside any funds or other assets for the
                      payment of the Supplemental Benefits under this Plan.
                      AlliedSignal may, in its sole discretion, establish funds
                      for payment of these Supplemental Benefits. However, any
                      and all such funds shall remain assets of AlliedSignal and
                      subject to the claims of creditors of such corporation.
                      Such funds, if any, shall not be deemed to be assets of
                      this Plan.

                (b)   Any person entitled to a Supplemental Benefit shall be
                      entitled to payment of such benefit only from the date on
                      which such Supplemental Benefit becomes due and payable
                      and only in such installments or other manner of payment
                      as is provided under the relevant Pension Plan or
                      agreement, provided, however, that if a Participant so
                      elects, by giving written notice to the Plan
                      Administrator, and if the Committee approves such
                      election, payment of such Supplemental Benefit shall be in
                      a lump sum equal to the present value of such
                      Participant&#39;s Supplemental Benefit accrued to the date of
                      such Participant&#39;s retirement under the relevant Pension
                      Plan or agreement. For the purpose of determining the
                      present value of a Participant&#39;s accrued Supplemental
                      Benefit, the PBGC immediate annuity rate and the UP 1984
                      mortality table shall be used. Except as may be permitted
                      pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of this
                      Paragraph (b), no person shall have a right to
                      acceleration of any such payment. No person shall be
                      entitled to anticipate such benefit by assignment, pledge
                      or

                      transfer in any form or manner prior to actual or
                      constructive receipt of payment.

                (c)   In the event that a Supplemental Benefit becomes payable
                      in accordance with this Article IV, Section 4.01,
                      Paragraph (b) and in the event the relevant Pension Plan
                      or agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
                      then the Participant shall have a right to only the
                      Supplemental Benefit accrued to the date of termination of
                      the relevant Pension Plan or agreement. In such event,
                      AlliedSignal shall remain liable for the payment of the
                      Supplemental Benefit and payment shall be made at such
                      times and in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall
                      determine, unless the Participant shall have made the
                      election referred to in Paragraph (b) of this Section
                      4.01, in which event payment shall be made pursuant to
                      such election, if approved by the Committee as therein
                      required. Such accrued Supplemental Benefit shall remain
                      subject to Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.01.

                (d)   The rights and interest of any participant, joint
                      annuitant or beneficiary to a Supplemental Benefit under
                      this Plan are the same as any other unsecured creditor of
                      Allied. In the event of any bankruptcy proceeding by or
                      against Allied, a participant, joint annuitant or
                      beneficiary shall be entitled to prove a claim for any
                      unpaid portion of the benefit provided by the Plan.


Article V - Administration

5.01            Plan Administrator - The Board of Directors shall name a Plan
                Administrator. Such Plan Administrator shall serve at the
                convenience of the Board of Directors and shall serve without
                compensation. The Plan Administrator shall keep such records as
                necessary for the proper administration of the Plan and shall
                report to the Board of Directors at such time or times as the
                Board of Directors shall designate.

5.02            Benefit Determination - The Plan Administrator shall determine
                the amount and timing of any benefit paid under the Plan. The
                Plan Administrator shall rely on the records of AlliedSignal in
                determining any participant&#39;s eligibility for and amount of
                benefit under the Plan. In the event that the Plan
                Administrator&#39;s reliance on the records of AlliedSignal causes a
                benefit to be over or under paid, the Plan Administrator shall
                adjust future payments to be increased or decreased as required.
                If such future payments are insufficient to recover any
                overpayment to a participant, the Plan Administrator shall
                withhold any payments then due a participant and take any action
                deemed appropriate to recover the balance of the overpayment.

5.03            Benefit Appeals - The Plan Administrator shall establish an
                appeals procedure as defined by U.S. Department of Labor
                regulations. Such procedures will provide that the participant
                has sixty (60) days upon receipt of any benefits or denial of
                benefits to file an appeal with the Plan Administrator. The Plan
                Administrator must respond within sixty (60) days of receiving
                the appeal, in writing, specifically identifying those Plan
                provisions on which the benefit denial was based and indicating
                what information the participant must supply in order to perfect
                a claim for benefits.


Article VI - Amendment and Termination

6.01            Plan Amendments - AlliedSignal reserves the right to amend the
                Plan from time to time. The Plan may be amended by the
                Committee, however, no amendment shall reduce any benefit being
                paid or then payable to a participant. Further, no amendment
                shall reduce the benefits provided by the Plan to participants
                or alter in any manner the rights of the participants to
                benefits provided under this Plan.

6.02            Plan Termination - AlliedSignal reserves the right to terminate
                the Plan. However, such termination shall not adversely affect
                the rights of participants.

MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
AlliedSignal Inc.

1997 COMPARED WITH 1996

DURING 1997, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE SHIFT OF ITS BUSINESS
PORTFOLIO TOWARD HIGHER GROWTH AND MARGINS. Acquisitions with aggregate annual
sales of $1.5 billion were announced. In June 1997, the Company acquired
Prestone Products Corporation (Prestone) for approximately $400 million,
including assumed liabilities. Prestone is a supplier of premium car care
products and has annual sales of approximately $300 million. In July 1997, the
Company acquired Grimes Aerospace Company (Grimes), a manufacturer of exterior
and interior aircraft lighting systems, for approximately $475 million,
including assumed liabilities. Grimes, which has annual sales of approximately
$230 million, also manufactures aircraft engine components such as valves and
heat exchangers, as well as electronic systems, including flight warning
computers and active matrix liquid crystal displays. In October 1997, the
Company acquired Astor Holdings, Inc. (Astor) for approximately $370 million,
including assumed liabilities. Astor, a producer of value-added, wax-based
processing aids, sealants and adhesives, has annual sales of approximately $300
million. In November 1997, the Company acquired Holt Lloyd Group Ltd. for
approximately $150 million. Holt Lloyd is a supplier of car care products
primarily in Europe and Asia and has annual sales of approximately $150 million.
In January 1998, the Company also acquired the Hardware Group and PacAero unit
of Banner Aerospace, distributors of aircraft hardware, for approximately $350
million. The acquired operations have annual sales of about $250 million,
principally to commercial air transport and general aviation customers. The
Company also made several smaller acquisitions in 1997, primarily in the
Engineered Materials segment.

THE COMPANY ALSO DIVESTED SOME BUSINESSES WHICH WERE PRIMARILY CYCLICAL IN
NATURE. In October 1997, the Company completed the sale of its automotive safety
restraints business to Breed Technologies for $710 million in cash, subject to
post-closing adjustments, and the Company recorded an after-tax gain of $196
million, or $0.35 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997 (all earnings per
share data in Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis reflect basic earnings per
share). The safety restraints business had 1996 net sales and income from
operations of $940 and $70 million, respectively, from the sale of seat belts
and air bags. It is expected that the proceeds will be used to continue to grow
the Company&#39;s higher-margin businesses and pursue acquisitions that will expand
or complement the Company&#39;s business portfolio. In April 1996, the Company sold
its worldwide hydraulic and anti-lock braking systems (ABS) business (braking
business) for $1.5 billion in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments
which were finalized in October 1997. See Note 4 of Notes to Financial
Statements for additional information. In the first quarter of 1998, the Company
expects to complete the sale of its underwater detection systems business to L-3
Communications Corporation for $70 million in cash, subject to post-closing
adjustments. The ocean systems unit had annual revenues of about $70 million.
During 1997, the Company also sold certain non-strategic businesses and other
assets.

The Company continuously assesses the relative strength of its portfolio
of businesses as to strategic fit, market position and profit contribution in
order to upgrade its combined portfolio and identify operating units that will
most benefit from increased investment. The Company considers acquisition
candidates that will further its strategic plan and strengthen its existing core
businesses. The Company also identifies operating units that do not fit into its
long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability
or growth potential. These operating units are considered for potential
divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning action.

IN 1997, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED ITS THREE SECTOR OFFICES, CONSOLIDATED ITS
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS GROUP AND REPOSITIONED SOME OF ITS BUSINESSES. A provision
of $250 million for repositioning and other charges (after-tax $159 million, or
$0.28 per share) was established in the fourth quarter. The components of this
charge include severance costs of $59 million, asset writedowns of $34 million
and other exit costs of $31 million, as well as $40 million relating to the
write-off of capitalized business process reengineering costs associated with
information technology projects as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 97-13, $13 million relating to the writedown of an investment and other
items consisting of asset impairments, customer claims and legal settlements.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE OF 15% IN THE QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK
DIVIDEND, FROM $0.13 TO $0.15 PER SHARE. The dividend increase will be effective
with the first quarter of 1998. The Company had previously increased its regular
quarterly dividend by 16% in the first quarter of 1997.

NET SALES in 1997 were $14,472 million, an increase of $501 million, or 4%,
compared with 1996. Of this increase, $1,178 million, or 8%, was due to volume
gains and $482 million from the consolidation of recent acquisitions, offset in
part by a $744 million reduction for disposed businesses, mainly in the
Automotive segment. Lower selling prices and the impact of foreign exchange
reduced sales for the Engineered Materials and Automotive segments by $415
million. Aerospace net sales increased $698 million, or 12%, and Engineered
Materials improved by $241 million, or 6%. Automotive net sales decreased $438
million, or 10%. Excluding the disposed braking and safety restraints
businesses, Automotive net sales increased $297 million, or 11%.

COST OF GOODS SOLD as a percent of net sales was 79.3% in 1997 compared with
83.1% in 1996. Included in 1997 and 1996 are repositioning and other charges
(special charges) totaling $237 and $637 million, respectively. See Note 3 of
Notes to Financial Statements for further information. Excluding these special
charges, 1997 cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was 77.7%, a decrease
compared with 78.5% in 1996 due in part to Six Sigma programs to lower
manufacturing and material costs and the improved mix of higher-margin
businesses.

                                                                              19


&lt;PAGE&gt;
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;

GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESS reflects the 1997 pretax gain of $226 million,
comprised of a $277 million gain on the sale of the safety restraints business,
partially offset by a charge of $51 million related to the settlement of the
sale of the braking business in 1996. The 1996 pretax gain of $655 million
resulted from the sale of the braking business. See Note 4 of Notes to
Financial Statements for further information.

INCOME FROM OPERATIONS of $1,636 million in 1997 improved by $127 million, or
8%, compared with 1996. Both 1997 and 1996 include pretax gains on the sales of
businesses as well as special charges (special items). Excluding the impact of
these special items, income from operations improved by $156 million, or 10%.
Aerospace income from operations increased 37%, but Engineered Materials and
Automotive income from operations decreased 4% and 15%, respectively. The
Company&#39;s operating margin was 11.4% in 1997, compared with 10.7% in 1996.
Productivity (the constant dollar relationship of sales to costs) improved by
5.9% over 1996, reflecting in part initiatives in manufacturing, materials,
product development and sales and marketing. See the detailed discussion of net
income below for information by industry segment.

EQUITY IN INCOME OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES of $178 million increased by $35
million, or 24%, compared with 1996, mainly due to higher earnings from the UOP
process technology joint venture (UOP), partially offset by the writedown of an
equity investment as part of the 1997 repositioning and other charges.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), $77 million income in 1997, decreased by $10 million, or
11%, compared with 1996 mainly due to increased minority interest offset in part
by higher foreign exchange gains.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES of $175 million in 1997 decreased by $11
million, or 6%, compared with 1996. This decrease results from lower tax
interest expense due to an acceleration of worldwide tax audits resulting in
favorable developments to the Company&#39;s position, offset in part by higher
debt-related interest expense reflecting higher levels of debt.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX rate in 1997 was 31.8% compared with 34.3% in 1996. Adjusted
for special items in both years, the effective tax rate in 1997 was 33.0%
compared with 33.5% in 1996.

NET INCOME in 1997 of $1,170 million, or $2.07 per share, was 15% higher than
1996 net income of $1,020 million, or $1.80 per share. Adjusted for special
items in both years, net income for 1997 was $1,166 million, or $2.06 per share,
an increase of 15% over 1996. The higher adjusted net income in 1997 was the
result of a substantial improvement in operating performance by the Aerospace
segment and moderately higher earnings by the Engineered Materials segment. The
Automotive segment had significantly lower earnings.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS follows. Adjusted net
income (see tables below) for the segments excludes the impact of the 1997 and
1996 special items. (Dollars in millions)

                                               Adjusted
Aerospace   Net Sales       Net Income       Net Income
- -------------------------------------------------------
1997           $6,412             $515             $529

- -------------------------------------------------------
Increase       $  698             $309             $144
=======================================================

Aerospace sales of $6,412 million in 1997 increased by $698 million, or 12%,
compared with 1996. Aerospace Equipment Systems sales were substantially higher,
driven by continued aftermarket strength and substantially higher
original-equipment shipments of engine fuel systems, environmental control
systems and aircraft landing systems. The acquisition of Grimes also contributed
$119 million of sales. Engines had significantly higher shipments of auxiliary
power units (APUs) and commercial propulsion end units and spares. Sales of
Electronic &amp; Avionics Systems were moderately higher reflecting strong demand
for flight management and safety avionics systems, including strong shipments of
enhanced ground proximity warning systems. Sales of electronic systems to the
U.S. and foreign governments, however, were lower, mainly at communications and
ocean systems. Sales of management and technical services to the U.S. Government
were moderately higher.

The Company&#39;s 1997 sales to the Department of Defense (DoD), as a prime
contractor and subcontractor, increased 8% compared with 1996. Sales to the DoD
accounted for 21% of Aerospace&#39;s total sales, a decrease of one percentage point
compared with 1996. Sales to the commercial and foreign government markets
increased 18%, while sales to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) and other U.S. Government agencies declined 14% in 1997.

Aerospace adjusted net income of $529 million in 1997 improved by $144 million,
or 37%, from the 1996 adjusted net income. Income from Aerospace Equipment
Systems and Engines was substantially higher due principally to increased sales
and productivity improvements. Earnings for Electronic &amp; Avionics Systems were
moderately higher reflecting increased demand, improved manufacturing operations
and material cost savings for flight safety avionics. However, electronic
systems had lower net income on reduced sales at communications and ocean
systems to the U.S. and foreign governments. Net income from management and
technical services for the U.S. Government improved slightly.

The Company is affected by U.S. Government budget constraints for defense and
space programs as well as the level of production of commercial, business and
general aviation aircraft which are impacted by business cycles and world
economic conditions. Growth in the Company&#39;s commercial business for aerospace
products is expected, over the long term, to help mitigate the reductions in
U.S. defense spending. Moreover, aerospace sales are not dependent on any one
key defense program or commercial customer.

In 1997, world defense spending stabilized after declining in prior years.
Meanwhile, substantial improvement was seen in the commercial aircraft market,
with build rates for large airlines at near record levels. This level of
commercial activity is expected to continue in 1998. Regional airlines
experienced strong traffic growth and new regional aircraft orders were also
higher in 1997. The high-end business aviation market experienced significant
growth and the commercial aftermarket spare parts and repair and overhaul
business also showed strong improvement during 1997, reflecting a 7% increase in
world airline passenger traffic.

The Company continues to receive significant contracts from the commercial
aviation industry, DoD and NASA and Aerospace earnings are expected to remain
strong.

At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had firm orders for its aerospace
products from the U.S. and foreign

============================================================

Automotive sales of $3,802 million in 1997 were $438 million, or 10%, lower
compared with 1996 reflecting the disposition of the braking and safety
restraints businesses. Excluding these businesses, Automotive sales increased by
$297 million, or 11%. Continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted
sales growth by 3%. Turbocharging Systems sales were significantly higher,
primarily reflecting the flow of new products and the popularity of turbocharged
vehicles in Europe. Truck Brake Systems sales in North America also improved
significantly, benefiting from an upturn in truck builds and increased
installation rates of ABS. The Automotive Products Group sales were moderately
higher reflecting $223 million of sales from the acquisitions of Prestone and
Holt Lloyd. Sales of other aftermarket products and friction materials were
lower reflecting in part unfavorable market conditions.

Automotive adjusted net income of $170 million in 1997 declined by $32 million,
or 16%, from the 1996 adjusted net income. The decrease primarily reflects the
absence of net income from the disposed braking and safety restraints
businesses. Excluding these businesses, Automotive net income increased by $11
million, or 9%. Turbocharging Systems had substantially higher net income due to
increased sales and productivity improvements. Net income for Truck Brake
Systems was also substantially higher due principally to strong sales volume.
Earnings for the Automotive Products Group decreased substantially, primarily in
the North American aftermarket business; however, improvement for friction
materials was a partial offset.

=======================================================================

Engineered Materials sales of $4,254 million in 1997 were $241 million, or 6%,
higher compared with 1996. Volume gains of 9% were partially offset by lower
selling prices and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Polymer sales were
higher due mainly to significant growth for engineering plastics, chemical
intermediates and specialty films. Lower sales of carpet fibers and industrial
polyester, mainly as a result of reduced selling prices and the strong U.S.
dollar, were partial offsets. Specialty Chemicals sales increased moderately due
to acquisitions and volume gains for chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement
products, hydrofluoric acid, pharmaceuticals and industrial specialties
products. Pricing pressures and the strong U.S. dollar were partial offsets.
Sales for Electronic Materials improved slightly reflecting increased demand for
advanced microelectronic materials and improvement in the printed circuit board
industry. Sales of amorphous metals, however, were lower.

Engineered Materials adjusted net income of $462 million in 1997 increased by
$30 million, or 7%, from the 1996 adjusted net income. Specialty Chemicals had
significantly higher earnings, driven by UOP and improvements for
pharmaceuticals and industrial specialties products. Polymers had moderately
lower income reflecting both higher raw material costs and lower selling prices
which reduced earnings for carpet fibers, industrial polyester and industrial
nylon. Partial offsets for Polymers resulted from higher income from chemical
intermediates, engineering plastics and specialty films due to sales increases.
Electronic Materials also had improved performance led by a substantial increase
in earnings for advanced microelectronic materials and the absence of losses
from the micro-optic devices business. Laminates was a partial offset as income
declined due to pricing pressures and poor results in Europe.

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, the Company is subject to various federal,
state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the
environment. The Company believes that as a general matter, its policies,
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of

are in accord with environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because
of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, the Company, like
other companies engaged in similar businesses, is a party to lawsuits and claims
and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with
environmental matters. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving
environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. The Company
continually conducts studies, individually at Company-owned sites, and jointly
as a member of industry groups at non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility
of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is the
Company&#39;s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally no
later than the completion of feasibility studies.

Remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were $90 and $87 million in
1997 and 1996, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $85
million in 1998. While annual expenditures may increase over time, the Company
expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. The
timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors, including regulatory
approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements
with other parties.

At December 31, 1997, the recorded liability for environmental matters was $414
million. In addition, in 1997 the Company incurred operating costs for ongoing
businesses of approximately $70 million and capital expenditures of $69 million
relating to compliance with environmental regulations.

Although the Company does not currently possess sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future
completion of studies or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of
the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
may be significant to the Company&#39;s consolidated results of operations.
Management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.

See Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company&#39;s
commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters.

REGARDING THE YEAR 2000 compliance issue for information systems, the Company
has recognized the need to ensure that its computer operations and operating
systems will not be adversely affected by the upcoming calendar year 2000 and is
cognizant of the time sensitive nature of the problem. The Company has assessed
how it may be impacted by Year 2000 and has formulated and commenced
implementation of a comprehensive plan to address known issues as they relate to
its information systems. The plan, as it relates to information systems,
involves a combination of software modification, upgrades and replacement. The
Company estimates that the cost of Year 2000 compliance for its information
systems will not have a material adverse effect on the future consolidated
results of operations of the Company. The Company is not yet able to estimate
the cost for Year 2000 compliance with respect to production systems, products,
customers and suppliers; however, based on a preliminary review, management does
not expect that such costs will have a material adverse effect on the future
consolidated results of operations of the Company.

REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, the Company, with operating and financing
activities in numerous countries and sales throughout the world, is exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
manages exposure to changes in interest rates through its regular borrowing and
investing decisions and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of interest
rate swap agreements. The objective of such risk management activity is to
minimize the cost of the Company&#39;s debt financing over an extended period of
time. The Company manages exposure to foreign currency exchange rates for
transactional items by matching and offsetting assets and liabilities and
thereafter through financial hedge contracts with third parties. The Company
does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
See Note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information on
financial instruments.

INFLATION has not been a significant factor for the Company in a number of
years. Cost increases for labor and material have generally been low, and any
impact has been offset by productivity enhancement programs, including Six Sigma
initiatives.

&lt;PAGE&gt;

TOTAL ASSETS at December 31, 1997 were $13,707 million, an increase of $878
million, or 7%, from December 31, 1996. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments at December 31, 1997 were $1,041 million, a decrease of $725 million
compared with December 31, 1996. The decrease mainly results from acquisitions
and common stock repurchases, partially offset by the proceeds received from the
sale of the automotive safety restraints business. Cash flow from operating
activities of $1,306 million increased by $110 million, or 9%, compared with
1996, principally due to the increase in net income. The Company&#39;s working
capital turnover was up slightly to 5.1x at December 31, 1997 from 5.0x at
December 31, 1996.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING available under the Company&#39;s revolving credit
agreement (Credit Agreement) was $750 million. The Credit Agreement supports the
issuance of commercial paper. There was $821 and $470 million of commercial
paper outstanding at year-end 1997 and 1996, respectively. Commercial paper
borrowing reached a high of $1,546 million during 1997.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end 1997 of $2,307 million increased $376 million. The
increase principally resulted from debt assumed in the Astor, Grimes and
Prestone acquisitions and to fund common stock repurchases during the year.
Long-term debt was reduced by $102 million during 1997. The Company&#39;s total debt
as a percent of capital was 31.7% at December 31, 1997, up from 29.5% at
year-end 1996. Long-term debt as a percent of capital was 19.7% at year-end
1997, down from 22.2% at year-end 1996. Subsequent to year-end 1997, the Company
issued $400 million of long-term debt. The proceeds from the issuance were used
to repay certain outstanding commercial paper of the Company. See Note 15 of
Notes to Financial Statements for details of long-term debt and a discussion of
the Credit Agreement.

THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 21.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $814 million in
1997. Common stock was repurchased to meet expected requirements for shares
issued under employee benefit plans, acquisitions and a shareowner dividend
reinvestment plan. At year-end 1997, the Company had 158.1 million shares of
common stock held in treasury carried at $2,665 million. As of year-end 1997,
the Company was authorized to repurchase 81.4 million shares of common stock.

At the 1997 Annual Meeting, shareowners approved an amendment to the Company&#39;s
certificate of incorporation which increased the number of authorized common
shares from 500 million to one billion. The additional shares are available for
stock splits, acquisitions and other purposes. The Company&#39;s common stock was
split 2-for-1 for owners of record as of August 21, 1997.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES during 1997 were $717 million, a decrease of $38 million
from the $755 million spent in 1996. Spending by the segments and Corporate
since 1995 is shown in Note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company&#39;s
total capital expenditures in 1998 are currently projected at approximately $700
million. These expenditures are expected to be principally financed by
internally generated funds. Approximately 62% of the projected 1998 expenditures
are planned for expansion and cost reduction, 28% for replacement and
maintenance and 10% for environmental projects.

1996 COMPARED WITH 1995

IN APRIL 1996, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS BRAKING BUSINESS WHICH HAD 1995 NET SALES
AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $2.0 BILLION AND $154 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. The
sale of the braking business resulted in a gain of $655 million (after-tax $368
million, or $0.65 per share). The Company received consideration of $1.5
billion, subject to certain post-closing adjustments which were finalized in
October 1997. See Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional
information. Excluded from the sale were brake friction materials, brake-related
sales to the independent aftermarket and the medium- and heavy-duty truck brake
systems business which is part of a joint venture with Knorr-Bremse AG.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1996, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $622
MILLION (AFTER-TAX $359 MILLION, OR $0.63 PER SHARE) RELATING TO THE COST OF
ACTIONS TO REPOSITION SOME OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS AND TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES AS WELL AS OTHER CHARGES. Actions are
being undertaken to consolidate production facilities, rationalize manufacturing
capacity and optimize operational capabilities. The components of the
repositioning charge include asset writedowns of $136 million, severance costs
of $127 million and other exit costs of $14 million. The repositioning actions
are expected to be completed in 1998 and will not materially impact the
Company&#39;s liquidity. Upon completion, the repositioning actions are expected to
generate additional annual income from operations of approximately $140 million.
The charge to recognize additional environmental liabilities amounted to $175
million. See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.

NET SALES in 1996 were $13,971 million, a decrease of $375 million, or 3%,
compared with 1995. Net sales were lower reflecting the sale of the braking
business. Excluding the braking business, net sales increased $1,019 million, or
8%. Of this increase, $794 million was due to volume gains, mainly by the
Aerospace segment, and $366 million from the consolidation of recent
acquisitions, offset in part by an $88 million reduction for disposed
businesses, mainly by the Engineered Materials segment. Selling prices and the
impact of foreign exchange were slightly unfavorable. Aerospace net sales
increased $630 million, or 12%, and Engineered Materials improved by $300
million, or 8%. Automotive net sales increased $85 million, or 2%.

COST OF GOODS SOLD as a percent of net sales was 83.1% in 1996 compared with
81.2% in 1995. Included in 1996 are repositioning and other charges totaling
$637 million, and 1995 reflects a provision of $115 million relating to the
revaluation of the ABS assets to their fair market value (special charges). See
Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information. Excluding these
special charges, 1996 cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was 78.5%, a
decrease compared with 80.4% in 1995 mainly due to productivity initiatives to
lower manufacturing and material costs.

GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESS represents the 1996 pretax gain of $655 million on the
sale of the braking business and the 1995 pretax gain of $71 million on the
transfer of the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) joint venture, Paxon Polymer
Company, L.P., to Exxon Chemical Company. See Note 4 of Notes to Financial
Statements for further information.

                                                                              23


&lt;PAGE&gt;
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;

INCOME FROM OPERATIONS of $1,509 million in 1996 improved by $249 million, or
20%, compared with 1995. Both 1996 and 1995 include pretax gains on the sales of
businesses as well as special charges (special items). Excluding the impact of
these special items, income from operations improved by $187 million, or 14%.
Aerospace income from operations increased 18% and Engineered Materials improved
15%, but Automotive income from operations decreased 11%. The Company&#39;s
operating margin was 10.7% in 1996, significantly higher than the 9.1% in 1995.
Productivity improved by 6.0% over 1995, reflecting in part initiatives in
manufacturing (Operational Excellence), product development (Technical
Excellence) and sales and marketing (Customer Excellence) and the sale of the
high-cost braking business. See the detailed discussion of net income below for
information by industry segment.

EQUITY IN INCOME OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES of $143 million decreased by $48
million, or 25%, compared with 1995 mainly because the Company exited its HDPE
joint venture in December 1995 and because of lower earnings from Knorr-Bremse
AG&#39;s truck brake systems joint venture. A partial offset was significantly
higher earnings from UOP.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), $87 million income in 1996, improved by $109 million
compared with 1995 mainly due to increased interest income (included in the
Corporate and Unallocated segment), primarily reflecting the investment of cash
received from the sale of the braking business, higher foreign exchange costs in
1995 and the minority interest share of the 1996 repositioning and other
charges.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES of $186 million in 1996 increased by $18
million, or 11%, compared with 1995 due to higher levels of short-term debt.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE in 1996 was 34.3% compared with 30.6% in 1995. Adjusted
for special items in both years, the effective tax rate in 1996 was 33.5%
compared with 33.0% in 1995.

NET INCOME in 1996 of $1,020 million, or $1.80 per share, was 17% higher than
net income of $875 million in 1995, or $1.54 per share. Adjusted for special
items in both years, net income for 1996 was $1,011 million, or $1.78 per share,
an increase of 16% over 1995 net income. The higher adjusted net income in 1996
was the result of a substantial improvement in the operating performance by the
Aerospace segment and higher earnings by the Engineered Materials segment. The
Automotive segment had moderately lower earnings.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS follows. Adjusted net
income (see tables below) for the segments excludes the impact of the 1996 and
1995 special items. (Dollars in millions)

Increase (Decrease)        $  630           $(97)           $ 82
================================================================

Aerospace sales of $5,714 million in 1996 increased $630 million, or 12%,
compared with 1995. Military aftermarket sales and sales to commercial original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) were substantially higher. Commercial aftermarket
sales also improved. Military OEM sales were lower. Engines had significantly
higher sales of commercial and military propulsion engines and APUs, including
significantly higher aftermarket parts and repair and overhaul sales. Aerospace
Equipment Systems also showed strong sales growth with gains across most product
lines, including engine fuel systems, environmental control systems and aircraft
landing systems to both the aftermarket and OEMs. Electronic &amp; Avionics Systems
sales improved slightly. Sales of communication and navigation systems increased
significantly reflecting the acquisition of a precision products business in
January 1996 and gains in guidance and control systems, but flight safety
systems sales were moderately lower, reflecting the completion in 1995 of the
program to install mandated traffic alert and collision avoidance systems (TCAS)
on commuter aircraft. Production problems at flight safety systems, resolved in
the latter part of the year, delayed the introduction of new products. Sales of
management and technical services to the U.S. Government were significantly
higher.

The Company&#39;s 1996 sales to the DoD, as a prime contractor and subcontractor,
increased 3% compared with 1995 despite reductions in U.S. defense spending.
Sales to the DoD accounted for 22% of Aerospace&#39;s total sales, a decrease of two
percentage points compared with 1995. Sales to the commercial and foreign
government markets increased 18%, while sales to NASA and other U.S. Government
agencies declined 1% in 1996.

Aerospace adjusted net income improved to $385 million from $303 million, an
increase of $82 million, or 27%, compared with 1995. Strong sales growth and
productivity resulted in substantially higher earnings for Engines and Aerospace
Equipment Systems. Increased management and technical services to the U.S.
Government also resulted in significant gains, but Electronic &amp; Avionics Systems
had moderately lower income. Flight safety systems had substantially reduced
earnings due to lower sales, manufacturing difficulties and certain
repositioning expenses excluded from the 1996 provision. Higher net income for
communication and navigation systems was a partial offset.

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had firm orders for its aerospace
products from the U.S. and foreign governments of $1,906 and $1,871 million,
respectively. Total backlog, including commercial contracts, at year-end 1996
and 1995 was $4,514 and $4,523 million, respectively.

=============================================================

Automotive sales of $4,240 million in 1996 were $1,309 million, or 24%, lower
than in 1995. However, excluding the divested braking business, Automotive sales
increased $85 million, or 2%. Safety Restraint Systems, primarily air bags, and
Turbocharging Systems had significantly higher sales volumes in Europe,
reflecting strong demand. Growth by Turbocharging Systems reflected the
continued preference by

24


&lt;PAGE&gt;
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;



European customers for turbocharged, diesel-powered cars, although turbocharger
sales were lower in Japan and North America. The Automotive Products Group had
slightly lower sales due to the impact of weak economic conditions on the
European aftermarket business, partially offset by significantly higher sales
for filters &amp; spark plugs due to new product introductions and higher original
equipment sales. Sales of friction materials increased slightly, mainly in North
America, and North American aftermarket sales were also slightly higher. Sales
of Truck Brake Systems in North America were lower primarily because of
decreasing medium- and heavy-duty truck production.

Automotive adjusted net income decreased to $202 million from $217 million in
1995, a $15 million, or 7%, decrease. The decrease reflects the absence of net
income from the divested braking business. Excluding the braking business,
Automotive net income increased substantially. The Automotive Products Group had
substantially higher income due to reductions in distribution costs for the
North American aftermarket business as well as significant sales gains and
manufacturing improvements for filters &amp; spark plugs. Higher sales resulting
from additional production capacity for Turbocharging Systems and Safety
Restraint Systems also resulted in significant net income gains.

====================================================================

Engineered Materials sales of $4,013 million in 1996 were $300 million, or 8%,
higher compared with 1995 principally due to acquisitions. Specialty Chemicals
sales increased substantially mainly reflecting the acquisition of Riedel-de
Haen in October 1995. The fluorine products business showed slight improvement
as the transition away from CFCs to substitute products was completed and the
business diversifies to include more fluorine specialty products. The Polymers
business had significantly higher sales of industrial fibers and engineering
plastics products, primarily due to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 1995.
Carpet fiber plants operated near capacity as stronger demand was driven by
sustained economic growth. Sales also increased for environmental catalysts,
carbon materials and amorphous metals. Sales for Electronic Materials were
moderately lower due to softness in the printed circuit board industry, however,
improved sales of advanced microelectronic materials were a partial offset.

Engineered Materials adjusted net income increased to $432 million from $402
million, a $30 million, or 7%, increase. Substantially higher earnings for
Specialty Chemicals was driven by UOP as the petrochemical and refining
industries continued to be strong worldwide. The acquisition of Riedel-de Haen
also contributed to higher earnings. Fluorine products net income also increased
due to sales growth and significant operational improvements. Net income was
significantly higher for the Polymers business, mainly reflecting improved
market conditions for carpet fiber and earnings from the Bridgestone/Firestone
acquisition in late 1995. Electronic Materials net income improved on higher
sales for advanced microelectronic materials. A partial offset to higher segment
income was the absence of earnings from the HDPE joint venture.

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, remedial response and voluntary cleanup
expenditures were $87 and $72 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively. In the
second quarter of 1996 the Company charged $175 million against pretax income
for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs. At December 31, 1996, the
recorded liability for environmental matters was $530 million. In addition, in
1996 the Company incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of
approximately $60 million and capital expenditures of $43 million relating to
compliance with environmental regulations.

TOTAL ASSETS at December 31, 1996 were $12,829 million, an increase of $364
million, or 3%, from December 31, 1995. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments at year-end 1996 were $1,766 million, an increase of $1,226 million
compared with December 31, 1995, primarily reflecting the proceeds received from
the sale of the braking business. Cash flows from operating activities of $1,196
million decreased by $20 million, or 2%, compared with 1995. The Company&#39;s
working capital turnover was down slightly to 5.0x at December 31, 1996 from
5.2x a year earlier.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING available under the Company&#39;s revolving Credit
Agreement was $750 million. The Credit Agreement supports the issuance of
commercial paper. There was $470 and $58 million of commercial paper outstanding
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Commercial paper borrowing reached
a high of $1,271 million during 1996.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end 1996 of $1,931 million decreased $79 million. Long-term
debt was reduced by $49 million during 1996. The Company&#39;s total debt as a
percent of capital was 29.5% at December 31, 1996, down from 33.7% at year-end
1995. Long-term debt as a percent of capital was 22.2% at year-end 1996, down
from 25.6% at year-end 1995. See Note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements for
details of long-term debt and a discussion of the Credit Agreement.

THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 14.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $409 million in
1996. Common stock was repurchased to meet expected requirements for shares
issued under employee benefit plans and a shareowner dividend reinvestment plan.
At year-end 1996, the Company had 150.8 million shares of common stock held in
treasury carried at $1,953 million. In December 1996, the Board of Directors
voted to increase the Company&#39;s common share repurchase authority by 100 million
shares.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES during 1996 were $755 million, an increase of $9 million
from the $746 million spent in 1995. Spending by the segments and Corporate
since 1995 is shown in Note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AlliedSignal Inc. (dollars in millions except per share amounts)

NOTE 1
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS include the accounts of AlliedSignal Inc. and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform
with the 1997 presentation.

INVENTORIES are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying domestic inventories and the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method for all other inventories.

INVESTMENTS are carried at market value, if readily determinable, or cost.
Investments in affiliates over which significant influence is exercised are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT are carried at cost and are generally depreciated
using estimated service lives, which range from 3 to 40 years. For the financial
statements, depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method.

COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over appropriate periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. The
cumulative amount of goodwill amortized at December 31, 1997 and 1996 is $476
and $423 million, respectively.

RECOGNITION OF CONTRACT REVENUES primarily relates to Aerospace operations.
Under fixed-price contracts, sales and related costs are recorded as deliveries
are made. Sales and related costs under cost-reimbursable contracts are recorded
as costs are incurred. Anticipated future losses on contracts are charged to
income when identified. Contracts which are part of a program are evaluated on
an overall program basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or
capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future
revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental
assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally no later than
the completion of feasibility studies. The liabilities for environmental costs
recorded in Accrued Liabilities and Other Liabilities at December 31, 1997 and
1996 were $110 and $304 million and $120 and $410 million, respectively.

INTEREST RATE SWAP, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION AGREEMENTS are accounted
for as a hedge of the related asset, liability, firm commitment or anticipated
transaction when designated and effective as a hedge of such items. Agreements
qualifying for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:

  Changes in the amount to be received or paid under interest rate swap
  agreements are recognized in Interest and Other Financial Charges.

  Gains and losses on foreign currency forward agreements and combination
  options (options purchased and written as a unit) used to hedge assets and
  liabilities, or net investments in foreign subsidiaries, are recognized in
  Other Income (Expense) and Cumulative Foreign Exchange Translation Adjustment,
  respectively.

  Gains and losses on foreign currency forward agreements used to hedge firm
  foreign currency commitments, and purchased foreign currency options used to
  hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, are recognized in the
  measurement of the hedged transaction when the transaction occurs.

Changes in the fair value of agreements not qualifying for hedge accounting are
recognized in Other Income (Expense).

The carrying value of each agreement is reported in Accounts and Notes
Receivable, Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities, as
appropriate.

INCOME TAXES are based on the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax
liabilities or assets reflect the impact of temporary differences between
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. Such amounts
are subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates
expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation
allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not
likely.

EARNINGS PER SHARE are calculated in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 -- &#34;Earnings per Share&#34; (SFAS No.
128), effective for 1997. SFAS No. 128 requires the Company to report both basic
earnings per share which is based on the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share which is based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding. All prior years earnings per share data in this
report have been recalculated to reflect the provisions of SFAS No. 128. All
earnings per share data in this report reflect basic earnings per share, unless
otherwise indicated. The details of the earnings per share calculations for the
years 1997, 1996 and 1995 follow:

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

For each of the years 1997, 1996 and 1995, there were outstanding stock options
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock
because the options exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common shares. In 1997, 1996 and 1995, the number of stock options not
included in the computation were 1,201,900, 35,000 and 1,241,350, respectively.
These options were outstanding at the end of each of the respective years.

A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT was announced by the Company on July 23, 1997. The
stock split was effected on September 15, 1997 for shareowners of record on
August 21, 1997. All share and per share data in this report reflects the stock
split for all periods presented.

REPOSITIONING AND OTHER CHARGES

In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $124
million relating to the costs to eliminate its three sector offices, consolidate
its Automotive Products Group and reposition some of its businesses. These
actions are intended to enhance the Company&#39;s competitiveness and productivity.
The components of this charge include severance costs of $59 million, asset
writedowns of $34 million and other exit costs of $31 million. All of the
actions are expected to be completed in 1998. The Company also recorded other
charges in the fourth quarter of 1997, including $40 million relating to the
write-off of capitalized business process reengineering costs associated with
information technology projects as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 97-13 and other items consisting of asset impairments, customer claims and
legal settlements.

Repositioning and other charges totaling $237 million are included as part of
Cost of Goods Sold for 1997. Equity in Income of Affiliated Companies includes a
charge of $13 million relating to the writedown of an equity investment. The

guidance regarding the manner in which existing authoritative accounting
literature is to be applied to the specific circumstances of recognizing,
measuring and disclosing environmental remediation liabilities. The adoption of
SOP 96-1 resulted in a pretax charge of $175 million, and is accounted for as a
change in estimate. The Company also recorded other charges primarily related to
changes made in employee benefit programs and in connection with customer and
former employee claims.

The amount of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain
subsidiaries prior to their acquisition in 1997 is $195 million with expiration
dates through the year 2011. The use of pre-acquisition operating losses is
subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does
not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the
carryforwards prior to their expiration. The Company also has foreign net
operating losses of $375 million which are available to reduce future income tax
payments in several countries, subject to varying expiration rules.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $355 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies, which are considered to
be permanently reinvested. Any U.S. taxes payable on foreign earnings which may
be remitted, however, will be substantially offset by foreign tax credits.

The Company is a party to agreements under which it can sell undivided interests
in designated pools of trade accounts receivable. During 1997 and 1996, the
average outstanding was $505 and $517 million, respectively. New receivables are
sold under the agreements as previously sold receivables are collected. During
1997, this represented an average collection period of 47 days or a replacement
of receivables of approximately eight times. At both December 31, 1997 and 1996,
customer accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been reduced
by $500 million reflecting such sales. The Company acts as an agent for the
purchasers in the collection and administration of the receivables.

====================================

The Company has a Five-Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a group of
19 banks with commitments aggregating $750 million. The funds available under
the Credit Agreement may be used for any corporate purpose. Loans under the
Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than June 30, 2002.
Annually, the Company may request that the maturity of the Credit Agreement be
extended by another year. The Company intends to request an extension of this
agreement in 1998. The Company has agreed to pay a facility fee of 0.065% per
annum on the aggregate commitment for the Credit Agreement, subject to increase
or decrease in the event of changes in the Company&#39;s long-term debt ratings. The
Credit Agreement does not restrict the Company&#39;s ability to pay dividends,
however, it does require the Company to maintain a minimum net worth of $3.1
billion. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary conditions and
events of default, the failure to comply with, or occurrence of, would prevent
any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Such events of default
include (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt and interest thereon, (b)
non-compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement covenants, (c)
cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances, (d) bankruptcy and (e)
defaults upon obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to
lend under the Credit Agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 30% or more of the Company&#39;s voting stock or, during any 12-month
period, individuals who were directors of the Company at the beginning of the
period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors (the Board).

Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be determined, at the
Company&#39;s option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the
floating base rate of the agent bank, 0.5% above the average CD rate, or 0.5%
above the Federal funds rate or (c) the average Eurocurrency rate of three
reference banks plus 0.135% (applicable margin). The applicable margin over the
Eurocurrency rate on the Credit Agreement is subject to increase or decrease if
the Company&#39;s long-term debt ratings change. The Company had no balance
outstanding under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 1997. The Credit
Agreement presently serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.

                                                                              33

NOTE 17

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financing activities, is
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which
may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. In
seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, the
Company manages exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities and, when
deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The
instruments utilized include forward, option and swap agreements. The Company
does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
The Company had no leveraged financial instruments at December 31, 1997 and
1996.

At December 31, 1997 and 1996, interest rate swap agreements effectively
changed $300 million of fixed-rate debt at an average rate of 9.53% in both
years to U.S. commercial paper based floating rate debt with an effective
average rate of 8.04% and 7.94%, respectively. Based on their terms, these
agreements will be terminated by the counterparty if short-term interest rates
drop below a predetermined level. Other interest rate swaps at December 31, 1997
and 1996 effectively changed $58 and $66 million, respectively, of London
Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) based floating rate debt at an average rate of
4.80% and 4.76%, respectively, to fixed rate debt with an effective average rate
of 6.81% and 7.00%, respectively. The Company&#39;s interest rate swaps mature
through the year 2000.

The Company&#39;s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises
from intercompany loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries, receivables,
payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions. The
Company attempts to have all such transaction exposures hedged with internal
natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities
have been exhausted, through derivative financial instruments with third parties
using forward or option agreements. The Company currently also uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge the Company&#39;s exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates for the translated U.S. dollar value of the net income
of a number of foreign subsidiaries. Forward and option agreements used to hedge
net income are marked to market and recognized immediately in income. The
Company&#39;s principal foreign currency exposures relate to the French franc, the
German deutsche mark, the British pound and the U.S. dollar. At December 31,
1997, the Company held or had written foreign currency forward and option
agreements, maturing through 1999. The Company only writes foreign currency
options in combination with purchased options as an integral transaction and
economic alternative to using forward agreements.

Financial instruments expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for
nonperformance and to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates.
The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific
minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to
monitor the amount of credit exposure. The Company&#39;s financial instrument
counterparties are substantial investment or commercial banks with significant
experience with such instruments. The Company also has procedures to monitor
the impact of market risk on the fair value and costs of its financial
instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency
rates. The Company manages market risk by restricting the use of derivative
financial instruments to hedging activities and by limiting potential interest
and currency rate exposures to amounts that are not material to the Company&#39;s
consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Because of the above
practices and procedures, management believes that the Company&#39;s credit and
market risk exposures from financial instruments are not significant at
December 31, 1997.

The values of the Company&#39;s outstanding derivative financial instruments at
December 31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows:

NOTE 19

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The Company has a 1993 Stock Plan and a 1985 Stock Plan available to grant
incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs),
restricted shares and restricted units (Units) to officers and other employees.
The 1993 Stock Plan provides for the annual grant of awards in an amount not in
excess of 1.5% of the total shares issued (including shares held in treasury) as
of December 31 of the year preceding the year of the award. Any shares that are
available for awards that are not utilized in a given year will be available for
use in subsequent years. There were 10,468,811 and 8,204,312 shares available
for future grants under the terms of the Company&#39;s stock option plans at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Incentive stock options have a term
determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board
(Committee), but not in excess of ten years from the date of grant.
Non-qualified stock options have been granted with terms of up to ten years and
one day. An option becomes exercisable at such times and in such installments as
set by the Committee. Options generally become exercisable over a three-year
period. SARs entitle an optionee to surrender unexercised stock options for cash
or stock equal to the excess of the fair market value of the surrendered shares
over the option value of such shares. Units have been granted to certain
employees, which entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock. At
December 31, 1997, there were 1,529,346 Units outstanding, including 215,920
Units granted in 1997, the restrictions on which generally lapse over periods
not exceeding ten years from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized
over the restricted period.

The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the
three years ended December 31, 1997:

The Company also has a Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Directors&#39; Plan)
under which restricted shares and options are granted. New directors receive
grants of 3,000 shares of common stock, subject to certain restrictions. In
addition, each director will be granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares of
common stock each year on the date of the annual meeting of shareowners. The
Company has set aside 450,000 shares for issuance under the Directors&#39; Plan.
Options generally become exercisable over a three-year period and have a term of
ten years from the date of grant.

All options were granted at not less than fair market value at dates of grant.

Treasury shares of common stock have been used upon exercise of stock options.
Differences between the cost of treasury stock used and the total option price
of shares exercised have been reflected in Additional Paid-in Capital during
1997 and Retained Earnings in prior years.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some
of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of its
business, including those relating to commercial transactions, government
contracts, product liability and environmental, health and safety matters.

In accordance with the Company&#39;s accounting policy described in Note 1 of Notes
to Financial Statements, liabilities are recorded for environmental matters
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies. Although the
Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate
the amounts of the liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies,
they may be significant to the consolidated results of operations, but
management does not expect that they will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position of the Company. With respect to all other
matters, while the ultimate results of these lawsuits, investigations and claims
cannot be determined, management does not expect that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial
position of the Company.

The Company has issued or is a party to various direct and indirect guarantees,
bank letters of credit and customer guarantees. Management does not expect these
guarantees will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position of the Company. 

NOTE 22

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW
AND OTHER INFORMATION

Cash and Cash Equivalents includes cash on hand and on deposit as well as highly
liquid debt instruments with maturities generally of three months or less. Cash
payments during the years 1997, 1996 and 1995 included interest of $191, $178
and $183 million and income taxes of $269, $221 and $185 million, respectively.

The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 1997 and 1996 was 6.0%.

During 1997, a subsidiary of the Company issued $112 million of preferred stock
to third-party investors and subsequently redeemed such stock prior to year-end.

NOTE 23

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company&#39;s U.S. retiree medical programs cover employees who retire with
pension eligibility for hospital, professional and other medical services. Most
of the programs require deductibles and copayments and virtually all are
integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are generally required based on
coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. The Company also sponsors retiree
life insurance programs which generally provide a flat benefit of at least two
thousand dollars or a benefit as a percent of pay.

36




&lt;PAGE&gt;
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;


The retiree medical and life insurance programs are not funded. Claims and
expenses are paid from the general assets of the Company.

For most non-union employees retiring after July 1, 1992, the Company has
implemented an approach which bases the Company&#39;s contribution to retiree
medical premiums on years of service and also establishes a maximum Company
contribution in the future at approximately twice the current level at the date
of implementation. Effective July 1, 1997, the Company adopted a plan amendment
that will encourage Medicare eligible non-union retirees to join Company
sponsored Medicare managed care programs. The Company uses the services of an
enrolled actuary to calculate postretirement benefit costs.

For measurement purposes, the assumed annual rates of increase in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits for 1997 were 6.75% to 8% for indemnity
programs and 6% to 8% for managed care programs, which reduce to 6% for all
programs in the year 2000 and remain at that level thereafter (except for
Medicare managed care programs which continue at 8%). The health care cost trend
rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. To
illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1997 by $129 million and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit
cost for the year then ended by $12 million. The weighted-average discount rate
used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25%
and 7.75% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1997, 1996 and 1995 included the
following components:

NOTE 24 

PENSIONS

The Company&#39;s pension plans, most of which are defined benefit plans and almost
all of which are noncontributory, cover substantially all employees. Benefits
under the plans are generally based on years of service and employees&#39;
compensation during the last years of employment or as a flat dollar benefit.
Benefits are generally paid from funds previously provided to trustees. In the
Company&#39;s principal U.S. plans, funds are contributed to a trustee as necessary
to provide for current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation
over a reasonable period. To the extent that these requirements are fully
covered by assets on hand for a plan, a contribution may not be made in a
particular year. At December 31, 1997, approximately 60% of the assets of U.S.
plans were held in equity securities, with the balance primarily in fixed
income-type securities. The Company uses the services of an enrolled actuary to
calculate the amount of pension expense and contributions to trustees of the
various pension plans.

Net periodic pension cost for 1997, 1996 and 1995 included the following
components:

Years ended December 31                            1997      1996      1995

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


[LOGO]


January 28, 1998

To the Shareowners and Directors of AlliedSignal Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, of retained earnings and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AlliedSignal
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#39;s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

                                    PART I.
 
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS


     AlliedSignal Inc. (with its consolidated subsidiaries sometimes referred to
in  this Report as the Company) was organized  in the State of Delaware in 1985.
The Company is the successor to  Allied Corporation, which was organized in  the
State of New York in 1920.
 
     The  Company&#39;s  operations  are conducted  under  three  business segments:
Aerospace, Automotive and Engineered Materials.
 
     The Company&#39;s  products  are  used  by  many  major  industries,  including
electronics,   motor  vehicles,  chemicals,  textiles,  construction,  plastics,
housing, telecommunications,  utilities,  packaging, agriculture,  military  and
commercial aviation, and in the space program. The following is a description of
the   Company&#39;s  three  business  segments  and  their  principal  products  and
activities.
 
AEROSPACE
 
     The Aerospace  segment  is  among the  world&#39;s  largest  manufacturers  and
suppliers  of  advanced  technology  products  and  services  for  the military,
commercial and general aviation, and space markets.
 
     Aerospace&#39;s principal  product  lines  are organized  into  four  strategic
business  units:  AlliedSignal  Engines (Engines),  Aerospace  Equipment Systems
(Equipment Systems),  Government  Electronic Systems  (Electronic  Systems)  and
Commercial Avionics Systems (Avionics Systems).
 
     The  Company serves key  military and commercial  segments of the aviation,
defense and space markets with a broad array of systems, subsystems,  components
and  services. It designs, develops, manufactures, markets and services hundreds
of products found on all types of aircraft, from single-piston engine  aircraft,
executive  aircraft  and wide-bodied  &#39;jumbos&#39; flown  by the  world&#39;s commercial
carriers, to trainers, transports, bombers, fighters and helicopters used by the
U.S. and other  countries for  national defense. The  Company&#39;s global  business
consists primarily of original equipment (OE) sales and an extensive aftermarket
business,  including  spare  parts, maintenance  and  repair,  and retrofitting.
Worldwide customers include the U.S. and  foreign governments, all of the  major
airframe and engine manufacturers, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed
Martin,   Airbus  Industrie  (Airbus),  British  Aerospace,  Cessna,  Fairchild,
Dassault, Gulfstream,  Bombardier,  Rockwell  International,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney,
General Electric (GE) and Rolls Royce, as well as the world&#39;s leading airlines.
 
     Principal products, manufactured for military aircraft, civil air transport
and   general  aviation  markets,  include  primary  propulsion,  consisting  of
turboprop, turbofan, turbojet  and turboshaft engines,  and auxiliary power  gas
turbine  engines; environmental control systems, consisting of air conditioning,
cabin  pressure  and  temperature  controls;  airborne  weather  avoidance   and
collision  avoidance radar systems;  forward-looking windshear detection systems
and wing ice detection systems; aircraft communications -- both voice and  data;
microwave  landing systems; automatic flight  control systems; pneumatic control
systems; engine and  flight instruments;  motion sensing and  air data  systems;
navigation   and   identification   equipment,   including   identification   of
friend-or-foe systems; flight  data recorders; cockpit  voice recorders;  ground
proximity  warning  systems;  electric power  generating  systems;  fuel control
systems; aircraft  wheels  and  brakes; brake  control  systems;  test  systems;
electromechanical  and hydraulic systems and components; heat transfer equipment
and engine  oil  cooling  systems. Other  products  include  electronic  cooling
systems and infrared radiation suppressors.
 
     The  Company also  manufactures products  for missiles,  spacecraft defense
command,  control   communication   and  intelligence   programs   and   oceanic
applications,  primarily  for  defense markets.  Products  include cryptographic
equipment, radar proximity fuzes, space-pointing  devices for deep space  probes
and  control  systems  for  spacecraft,  gyroscopes  for  tactical  missiles and
military aircraft, antisubmarine  warfare systems as  well as field  engineering
management  and technical support services to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
 
     In October 1994 the Company completed the purchase of the Lycoming  Turbine
Engine  Division of Textron Inc. (Lycoming Engine). The acquisition extended the
Company&#39;s turbine engine product
 
                                       4
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
offerings into the 50- to 115-seat  regional aircraft market and in  helicopters
and  other commercial and military applications.  Lycoming Engine had 1994 sales
of $550 million.
 
     In January 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of Northrop  Grumman
Corporation&#39;s  precision products business based  in Norwood, Massachusetts. The
business, which  has  annual sales  of  approximately $39 million,  manufactures
inertial  and sensor products  for military and space  markets. In addition, the
Company sold its military  landing gear business  to Coltec Industries&#39;  Menasco
unit.
 
     The  Company is affected by the level of expenditures for defense and space
programs and  the  level  of  production  of  commercial  and  general  aviation
aircraft.  The Company&#39;s  aerospace products are  sold directly to  the U.S. and
foreign governments,  aircraft manufacturers  and  commercial airlines,  and  to
dealers and distributors of general aviation products.
 
     Moderate growth in the Company&#39;s commercial business for aerospace products
is  expected,  over the  long  term, to  mitigate  a reduction  in  U.S. defense
spending. Moreover, aerospace  sales are not  dependent on any  one key  defense
program   or  commercial   customer.  However,   contract  awards   by  aircraft
manufacturers, some of which are discussed below, can be canceled or reduced  if
aircraft  orders are cut back. The products and services are sold in competition
with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have  substantial
financial  resources  and  significant technological  capabilities.  Among those
companies that  compete with  several of  the segment&#39;s  product areas  are  GE,
Honeywell,  Rockwell  International,  Sundstrand, United  Technologies  and B.F.
Goodrich.
 
     Sales to the U.S.  government, acting through  its various departments  and
agencies  and through prime contractors, amounted to $1,806 million for 1995 and
$1,886 million  for 1994,  which  amounts include  sales  to the  Department  of
Defense  of $1,205 million in 1995 and $1,300 million in 1994. Approximately 54%
and 59% of sales  to the U.S.  government in 1995  and 1994, respectively,  were
made  under fixed-price  contracts in  which the  Company agrees  to perform the
contract for a fixed price and retains  for itself any benefits of cost  savings
or must bear the burden of cost overruns.
 
     Government  contracts are generally  terminable by the  government at will.
Upon termination,  the  contractor is  normally  entitled to  reimbursement  for
allowable  costs and  to an  allowance for profit.  However, if  the contract is
terminated because of the contractor&#39;s  default, the contractor may not  recover
all  of  its costs  and  may be  liable  for any  excess  costs incurred  by the
government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
 
     The Company, as are other government contractors, is subject to  government
investigations  of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations.  Although  such  regulations  provide  that  a  contractor  may  be
suspended or debarred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the  outcome  of  pending  government investigations  cannot  be  predicted with
certainty, management is not presently aware of any such investigation which  it
expects will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
     Orders  for  certain  products  sold  to  general  and  commercial aviation
customers  mainly  consist  of  relatively  short-term  and  frequently  renewed
commitments.  Government procurement agencies generally issue contracts covering
relatively long periods  of time. Total  backlog for products  and services  for
both government and commercial contracts was $4,523 million at December 31, 1995
and  $4,730 million at  December 31, 1994  of which U.S.  and foreign government
orders were $1,871  million and  $1,803 million  for the  respective years.  The
Company  anticipates that approximately $3,010 million of the total 1995 backlog
will be filled during 1996.
 
     The Aerospace  segment&#39;s  international  operations  consist  primarily  of
exporting   U.S.  manufactured  products,  performance  of  services,  operating
aircraft repair and overhaul facilities and licensing activities. The  principal
manufacturing facility outside of the U.S. is in Canada.
 
     In 1995, as in the prior year, world defense spending continued to decline.
However,  most major  U.S. and international  airlines operated  in an improving
economic environment. The  modest turnaround that  began in the  second half  of
1993,  continued in  1994 and strengthened  significantly in  1995. The regional
airlines experienced strong growth while the high-end corporate aviation  market
showed moderate growth.
 
     Aerospace received a number of significant contracts during 1995.

contract having a potential sales value of $20 million by the U.S. Navy (USN) to
provide F-18 wheel and brake spare parts and contracts for various valve systems
on  the Seawolf and  New Attack submarines.  Raytheon Aircraft selected Avionics
Systems to supply avionics for the  new U.S. Air Force (USAF)/USN Joint  Primary
Aircraft  Training  System  aircraft.  The  USN/Marine  Corps  selected Avionics
Systems&#39; new flat-panel,  color liquid  crystal displays  to replace  up to  700
mechanical horizontal situation indicators in its H46 helicopters.
 
     In  the general aviation  market, the Company  received several significant
contracts. Engine&#39;s new RE100 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) was selected by Learjet
as the  standard option  for its  new Lear  45 business  jet. Equipment  Systems
received  a  contract to  supply the  air conditioning  system for  Cessna&#39;s new
Citation Excel turbofan aircraft. Avionics Systems was selected by Cessna to  be
the  exclusive supplier of avionics for  the rebirth of the single-piston-engine
aircraft.
 
     A number of airlines selected Equipment Systems for their wheels and brakes
for new aircraft, including: Japan Air System for wheels and brakes for its  new
fleet  of Boeing 777 aircraft  in a contract with  potential sales valued at $54
million; Egyptair for  wheels and  carbon brakes  for the  airline&#39;s new  Airbus
A340s  and Boeing 777s; and Shandong Airlines  for wheels and brakes for its new
Boeing 737  aircraft.  The Company  was  also  chosen by  McDonnell  Douglas  to
assemble  and deliver an integrated landing system, including wheels and brakes,
for its new MD-95 twin-jet aircraft.
 
     In the helicopter market, McDonnell Douglas chose the Company&#39;s Bendix/King
and Global Wulfsberg avionics for its new Explorer helicopter in a contract with
a sales potential  of $50 million.  Light Helicopter Turbine  Engine Company,  a
partnership  with the Allison  Engine Company, signed  a contract with Hindustan
Aeronautics Ltd.  to provide  CTS800  commercial turboshaft  engines for  a  new
advanced  light helicopter. Projections of 300  helicopters could result in more
than $150 million in engine sales.
 
     AlliedSignal Technical Services  Corp. (ATSC)  received a  contract with  a
$200  million sales potential from the  USAF to provide maintenance, engineering
services and modifications to the Air Force Satellite Control Network.
 
                                       6

AUTOMOTIVE
 
     The Automotive  segment designs,  engineers  and manufactures  systems  and
components  for worldwide  vehicle manufacturers and  aftermarket customers. The
segment&#39;s principal  business  areas  are braking  systems,  engine  components,
safety  restraint systems  and the  aftermarket. Within  each area,  the segment
offers a wide range of products for  passenger cars and light, medium and  heavy
trucks.
 
     For  manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks, the Company provides
disc and drum brakes, power brake  boosters and master cylinders, brake  valves,
wheel  end products, friction materials, spark plugs, turbochargers and occupant
protection systems (seat belts, air bags and related components).
 
     The Company&#39;s primary product offerings for the manufacturers of medium and
heavy trucks and  off-road vehicles  primarily include air  and hydraulic  brake
actuation  components, air and hydraulic drum and disc brakes, anti-lock braking
systems (ABS), compressors,  air dryers, friction  materials, turbochargers  and
charge-air intercoolers.
 
     The  aftermarket business includes replacement parts  for most of the above
items as well as air, oil and  fuel filters, wire and cable products, and  brake
sealants and fluids.
 
     Automotive  operations are located in  the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,  Poland,
Portugal,  South Korea, Spain,  Turkey and the  United Kingdom. Distribution and
marketing  are  conducted  in  these  and  numerous  other  countries  as  well.
Internationally, products are marketed under the Bendix, Fram, Autolite, Garrett
and Jurid trademarks.
 
     Worldwide  passenger car and truck OE sales accounted for approximately 74%
in both  1995  and  1994  of  the net  sales  of  the  Automotive  segment  with
aftermarket  sales  accounting  for the  balance.  In 1995  and  1994 Automotive
operations outside the U.S. accounted for  $2,499 and $2,217 million, or 45%  in
both years, of worldwide sales.
 
     In 1995 and 1994 sales of automotive OE systems and components were made to
approximately  30  customers  of  which the  Company&#39;s  five  largest automotive
manufacturing customers accounted for  approximately 52% and 56%,  respectively,
of  such sales. Total worldwide sales (for  OE and aftermarket use) for 1995 and
1994 to the Company&#39;s five  largest automotive manufacturing customers  amounted
to  $2,138 and $2,063 million, including sales to Ford Motor Company (Ford), the
segment&#39;s largest customer, of $887 and $782 million for the respective years.
 
                                       8
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
     The segment&#39;s operations  outside the  U.S. are  conducted through  various
foreign  companies  in which  it has  interests ranging  from minor  to complete
control.  International   operations  also   include  the   exporting  of   U.S.
manufactured products and licensing activities.
 
     The Automotive segment&#39;s products are sold in highly competitive markets to
customers  who demand performance, quality and competitive prices. Virtually all
automotive components are sold in  competition with other independent  suppliers
or  with the captive component divisions of the vehicle manufacturers. While the
Company&#39;s competitive position varies among  its products, the Company  believes
it  is a  significant factor  in each  of its  major product  markets. The major
independent competitors in one or more major business areas include: ITT  Teves,
Lucas  Girling,  Rockwell-WABCO,  Dana, Autoliv,  Cooper  Industries, Schwitzer,
Midland, Bosch, Kelsey Hayes, KKK,  TRW, Purolator, Delco, AM Brake,  Raybestos,
Takata and Morton.
 
     In  1994 the  Company established  two joint  ventures in  Europe, one with
Sogefi S.p.A. and the other with Gilardini, a subsidiary of Fiat, and Sequa. The
joint venture with  Sogefi S.p.A.,  a European manufacturer  and distributor  of
automotive  filters and other automotive products,  has enabled both partners to
penetrate new markets through a joint  distribution network and to reduce  costs
through  consolidation of  both warehouses  and distribution  centers. The joint
venture with Gilardini and Sequa -- BAG, S.p.A. -- which began operations in the
third quarter  of  1995,  manufactures and supplies hybrid inflators for driver-
and passenger-side air bag modules that are assembled by the Company&#39;s new plant
in  Italy.  Hybrid  inflators  provide  a cost-efficient method of inflating air
bags, using  compressed  argon  gas  and  a proprietary environmentally-friendly
solid generant from the Atlantic Research Corporation, which is used to heat the
gas. These operations  provide  the  Company with an entry into the European air
bag  market.  In January 1995 the Company and Jidosha Kiki Co. of Japan formed a
joint venture to supply brake boosters for vehicles built in Europe  by Japanese
manufacturers. The venture is based in Pamplona, Spain.
 
     In late December 1994 the Company acquired Ford&#39;s spark plug  manufacturing
plant  in  Treforest,  South  Wales.  The  acquisition  enhanced  the  Company&#39;s
relationship with Ford as its sole supplier of spark plugs in both North America
and Europe  and  provides a  manufacturing  base in  Europe  for growth  in  the
aftermarket spark plug business.
 
     In  April  1995 the  Company acquired  the Budd  Company&#39;s Wheel  and Brake
Division, whose products include: rotors, hubs, drums and related assemblies for
passenger cars  and  light trucks;  steel  disk  wheels for  heavy  trucks;  and
demountable  rims and hub and drum assemblies for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.
The Wheel and Brake Division had 1994 sales of over $300 million.
 
     In June 1995 the  Company acquired Fiat Auto  Poland S.A. (Fiat)&#39;s  braking
business  in  Poland,  whose  products  include  disc  and  drum  brakes, master
cylinders and  brake boosters;  and  became the  exclusive supplier  of  braking
systems to Fiat in Poland. The manufacturing facility of the business is located
in Twargodora, Poland. Annual sales approximate $30 million.
 
     In 1995 the Company purchased Transturk Holding&#39;s 68% interest in Transturk
Fren  Donanim Industriesi AS, a leading Turkish manufacturer of braking systems.
The acquisition brings the  Company&#39;s investment in the  company to 80%.  Annual
sales approximate $27 million.
 
     Construction  of a new turbocharger plant  in Shanghai, China was completed
and production began  in September 1995.  This facility enables  the Company  to
serve   the  rapidly  growing   diesel  engine  market   in  China  and  provide
turbochargers to international markets as opportunities develop.
 
     Automotive, as previously announced, has decided to exit the  light-vehicle
ABS  business  and  is  conducting  discussions  concerning  the  future  of its
light-vehicle braking  business.  Exiting  the ABS  business  could  hinder  the
Company&#39;s  ability to remain a first  tier supplier of complete braking systems.
The Company expects that neither exiting the ABS business nor the absence of  an
agreement  regarding the  light-vehicle braking  business would  have a material
impact on the Company&#39;s results of operations or financial position in 1996. The
ABS actions do not affect the  heavy-truck ABS business, in which the  Company&#39;s
joint venture with Knorr-Bremse has a significant market position.
 
     In  addition, a  reduction in  the Automotive  workforce was  announced and
substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 1995. The reduction  eliminates
approximately  3,100 full-time-equivalent positions.  The workforce reduction is
expected to be completed by the end of 1996.

ENGINEERED MATERIALS
 
     The Engineered  Materials  segment is  composed  of four  major  divisions:
Polymers,  Fluorine Products, Specialty Chemicals  and Electronic Materials. The
Specialty Chemicals and Electronic Materials  divisions were formed in  February
1996 by realigning some of Engineered Materials&#39; businesses in order to increase
the focus on the rapidly growing global markets these divisions serve.
 
     Polymers.  The  Polymers  division  consists  of  the  Fibers  and Plastics
businesses  which  were  combined  in  1995  to  enhance  the  units&#39;   vertical
integration and ensure optimization throughout the nylon system.
 
     The Company&#39;s Fibers business is a leading producer of type 6 nylon and the
third  largest producer  of nylon in  the U.S.  The Company is  also the largest
domestic producer of  caprolactam, the  primary intermediate for  type 6  nylon,
from  which it produces fine and heavy  denier nylon yarns and molding compounds
and film. These  yarns are sold  under the trademarks  Anso&#39;r&#39;, Anso X&#39;r&#39;,  Anso
IV&#39;r&#39;,  Anso V&#39;r&#39;, Worry-Free&#39;r&#39;, CrushResisterTM  and Caprolan&#39;r&#39;. In addition,
the Company produces heavy denier  polyester yarns. The Company primarily  sells
yarns to the carpet, textile, motor vehicle and industrial markets.
 
     In the carpet yarn markets, both continuous filament and staple nylon yarns
are  sold to yarn processors  and mills for the  manufacture of carpeting. Nylon
filament and staple are the dominant fiber yarns used in carpet production.  The
four  largest  producers,  including  the Company,  have  over  90%  of domestic
capacity.  The  Company  has  achieved  recognition  as  a  leader  in   product
development and has developed a strong customer base. Brand identity, service to
customers  and quality are important competitive factors in the market and there
is considerable price competition.
 
     In the motor vehicle and industrial markets, the Company&#39;s primary products
are nylon  and  polyester  yarns  for  use in  tire  cord,  seat  belts,  hoses,
tarpaulins  and  outdoor  furniture.  In 1995  the  Company  announced  plans to
increase capacity  at its  industrial polyester  yarn facility  in  Longlaville,
France  at a  cost of  approximately $45 million.  In November  1995 the Company
acquired Bridgestone/Firestone&#39;s  50  million-pound industrial  polyester  fiber
plant  in  Hopewell,  Virginia.  With  anticipated  modernization,  the  Company
believes that the Hopewell  plant will have annual  sales of approximately  $100
million.  The  Company  believes that  polyester  yarn will  become  the primary
reinforcement for passenger car radial tires in the world in the late 1990s  and
is exploring development opportunities in the Asia/Pacific region.
 
     The  textile fibers markets, where the Company sells Caprolan&#39;r&#39; nylon flat
yarns for warp knit and  weaving applications, include intimate apparel,  sports
outerwear,  jackets and such recreational products  as sleeping bags, back packs
and luggage. The industry is highly price competitive.
 
     The Plastics  business manufactures  and  markets engineering  resins.  The
Company  is a leading producer of nylon 6 engineering resins (Capron&#39;r&#39;) for the
automotive, electrical and electronic component,  food packaging, lawn care  and
power tool markets.
 
     In  October 1995  the Company  acquired the  nylon plastics  and industrial
fibers manufacturing facilities in Rudolstadt, Germany, from the German state of
Thuringia. The Company plans to invest about $100 million during the next  three
years to expand and upgrade the facility.
 
     Fluorine Products. The Fluorine Products business consists of Hydrofluoric
Acid (HF), Fluorocarbons,  Nuclear  Services,  Sulfur  Hexafluoride  (SF6)  and
Sterilant Gases.
 
     The Company is the world&#39;s largest producer of HF and an industry leader in
the production and sale  of products derived  from HF, including  fluorocarbons,
SF6 and uranium hexafluoride (UF6).
 
     Genetron&#39;r&#39;  fluorocarbons  are  sold  mainly  as  refrigerants  to  OE and
replacement manufacturers of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and as
foam blowing agents to rigid foam producers. Genesolv&#39;r&#39; fluorocarbons are  sold
as  solvents in precision cleaning applications  such as electronics, optics and
aerospace applications. The Montreal Protocol (Protocol), which has been  signed
by  the United States, regulates  worldwide chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) production
and consumption. With few exceptions, the Protocol required 100% elimination  of
fully  halogenated CFC production by industrialized countries as of December 31,
1995. The amended U.S. Clean Air Act also regulates CFCs and similarly  required
that  most  U.S.  production  of  CFCs  be  phased  out  by  the  end  of  1995.
 
                                       10
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
CFCs produced in the U.S. are also  subject to the Ozone Depleting Chemical  Tax
of  the Revenue Reconciliation  Act of 1989. In  accordance with applicable law,
the Company&#39;s Genetron&#39;r&#39; and Genesolv&#39;r&#39; products include CFCs.
 
     The Company is continuing  its efforts to develop  environmentally-friendly
fluorocarbon  products as it replaces the  current CFC product line. An existing
commercial plant in El Segundo, California was converted in 1991 to  manufacture
hydrochlorofluorocarbon  (HCFC)-141b,  a key  substitute  for CFC-11,  a blowing
agent in urethane foams,  and as a replacement  for CFC-113 in critical  solvent
applications.  By 1994 the Company more than  tripled the plant&#39;s capacity to 60
million pounds  per year.  The  Company has  commercialized key  CFC  substitute
products  in  various applications,  including  automotive air  conditioning and
residential, commercial and  industrial refrigeration. In  this connection,  the
Company  began manufacturing environmentally-friendly alternatives  to CFCs at a
new $70 million multi-product commercial facility in Geismar, Louisiana targeted
primarily at  the  substitute  products  HCFC-123,  HCFC-124,  hydrofluorocarbon
(HFC)-125  and HFC-134a. The Company is  continuing its research and development
efforts in view of the changing regulatory environment in which it operates. The
Company cannot predict the impact of possible future regulatory issues.
 
     The Company acquired the  CFC business of Akzo  NV, with facilities in  the
Netherlands,  in  April 1994.  This acquisition  has  provided the  Company with
access to new markets for its fluorocarbon products.
 
     The Company&#39;s Nuclear Services business processes uranium ore  concentrates
into  UF6 which is an essential intermediate  in the production of fuel elements
for nuclear  power  reactors  for  domestic and  foreign  customers.  A  Company
subsidiary  is in  partnership with a  General Atomics&#39; affiliate  to market UF6
conversion services supplied by the Company&#39;s Metropolis, Illinois manufacturing
facility. The partnership, ConverDyn,  competes for the  open world market  with
four foreign processors that are either government owned or controlled.
 
     The  Company is one of two domestic  producers of SF6, a gas primarily used
by  utilities  because  of  its  electrical  insulatory  properties  in  circuit
breakers, switches, transmission lines and electronic minisubstations.
 
     The Company also produces sterilant gases which primarily consist of blends
of  ethylene oxide and fluorocarbons that  are sold to hospitals, medical device
manufacturers and  contract  sterilizers.  The Company  holds  the  patents  for
selected sterilant gas blends using environmentally-friendly fluorocarbons.
 
     Specialty  Chemicals. Businesses  included are  Riedel-de Haen, Performance
Chemicals,  A-C&#39;r&#39;  Performance  Additives,   the  UOP  joint  venture,   Carbon
Materials, the Environmental Catalysts joint venture and Specialty Films.
 
     In  October  1995  the Company  purchased  Hoechst AG&#39;s  95.8%  interest in
Riedel-de Haen  AG,  a  specialty  chemicals  manufacturer  located  in  Seelze,
Germany.  Riedel-de  Haen  manufactures  products  for  the  pharmaceutical  and
electronics industries, as well as  coatings, photo dyes and specialty  pigments
markets. Annual sales approximate $250 million.
 
     The Performance Chemicals business is a leading supplier of specialty oxime
chemicals  for use in the  agricultural, coatings, photographic, pharmaceutical,
adhesives and  sealants,  and  mining  industries. The  Company  has  some  cost
benefits from its captive source of hydroxylamine sulfate.
 
     A-C&#39;r&#39;  Performance Additives are low-molecular weight polyethylene polymer
additives which primarily serve the  textiles, plastics, adhesives and  polishes
specialty markets worldwide.
 
     UOP  is an equally owned joint venture with Union Carbide Corporation which
designs and  licenses processes,  and  produces and  markets catalysts  for  the
petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical and food industries.
 
     The  Carbon Materials business produces binder pitch for electrodes for the
aluminum and  carbon industries,  creosote oils  as preservatives  for the  wood
products   and  carbon  black   markets,  refined  naphthalene   as  a  chemical
intermediate, and driveway  sealer tar  and roofing pitch  for the  construction
industry.  All of the tar products are  distilled from coal tar, a by-product of
the steel industry&#39;s coking operations.
 
                                       11
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
     The Environmental  Catalysts  business is  a  major worldwide  supplier  of
catalysts  used in  catalytic converters for  automobiles. In  November 1994 the
Company and General Motors  Corporation (GM) formed a  joint venture to  produce
coated  automotive catalytic  converter substrates. The  Company contributed its
environmental catalysts business and  GM contributed coating-related  technology
and a long-term supply contract to the joint venture.
 
     Major   products  in  the  Specialty  Films  business  include  cast  nylon
(Capran&#39;r&#39;), biaxially  oriented nylon  film  (Biax&#39;r&#39;) and  fluoropolymer  film
(Aclar&#39;r&#39;).  Specialty  film  markets include  food,  pharmaceutical,  and other
packaging and industrial applications. The Company plans to begin  manufacturing
SpectraVueTM, a line of thin plastic films that significantly improves the image
quality  of Liquid Crystal  Displays, during 1996.  The Company will manufacture
SpectraVueTM components  from  a new  $25  million facility  in  Elizabeth,  New
Jersey.
 
     Electronic  Materials. Businesses  included are  Laminate Systems, Advanced
Microelectronic Materials and Amorphous Metals.
 
     Laminate Systems manufactures  circuit board laminates  for the  electronic
and  electrical industries. The Company&#39;s product  line includes copper clad and
unclad  laminates  used  in  computer,  telecommunication,  instrumentation  and
military  applications.  Approximately 55%  of  sales are  to  the international
market, primarily  in southeast  Asia  and throughout  Europe. The  industry  is
highly  price competitive.  The Company, in  partnership with  Mitsui Mining and
Smelting Company, is backward integrated in electro deposited copper foil.  This
unit  also manufactures electrical grade glass yarns in partnership with Nittobo
Corporation of Japan.
 
     The Advanced  Microelectronics  Materials business  designs,  develops  and
manufactures  materials for semiconductor companies  worldwide. The Company is a

stock, copper,  aluminum,  platinum  and titanium.  The  Company  believes  that
sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate.
 
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 
     The   Company  owns   approximately  14,000   patents  or   pending  patent
applications and  is  licensed  under  other patents  covering  certain  of  its
products  and processes.  It believes that,  in the aggregate,  the rights under
such patents and licenses  are generally important to  its operations, but  does
not  consider that any patent or license or  group of them related to a specific
process or product is of material importance in relation to the Company&#39;s  total
business.
 
     The  Company also has  registered trademarks for a  number of its products.
Some of the  more significant  trademarks include:  AiResearch, Anso,  Autolite,
Bendix,  Bendix/King, Capron, Fram,  Garrett, Genetron, Jurid,  King and Norplex
Oak.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company&#39;s research  activities are  directed toward  the discovery  and
development of new products and processes, improvements in existing products and
processes, and the development of new uses of existing products.
 
     Research  and development  expense totaled $353,  $318 and  $313 million in
1995, 1994  and 1993,  respectively.  Customer-sponsored (principally  the  U.S.
government)  research and development activities amounted to an additional $536,
$486 and $514 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     The Company has approximately 48  research facilities which provide  direct
support to the operating segments.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
     The  Company is  subject to various  federal, state  and local requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment. It is the Company&#39;s policy to comply  with
these  requirements  and the  Company believes  that, as  a general  matter, its
policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable
risk  of  environmental  damage,  and  of  resulting  financial  liability,   in
connection  with its  business. Some risk  of environmental  damage is, however,
inherent in particular  operations and products  of the Company,  as it is  with
other  companies  engaged in  similar businesses.  (See  the description  of the
Engineered Materials  segment, above,  for information  regarding regulation  of
CFCs.)
 
     The  Company is and has  been engaged in the  handling, manufacture, use or
disposal of many substances which are classified as hazardous or toxic by one or
more regulatory agencies. The  Company believes that, as  a general matter,  its
handling,  manufacture, use and  disposal of such substances  are in accord with
environmental laws  and  regulations.  It  is  possible,  however,  that  future
knowledge   or  other  developments,  such  as  improved  capability  to  detect
substances in  the  environment,  increasingly  strict  environmental  laws  and
standards  and enforcement  policies thereunder,  could bring  into question the
Company&#39;s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of such substances.
 
     Among other  environmental  requirements, the  Company  is subject  to  the
federal  Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which the Company has been
designated as a potentially  responsible party which may  be liable for  cleanup
costs  associated with various hazardous  waste sites, some of  which are on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Superfund priority list. Although,  under
some  court  interpretations  of  these  laws, there  is  a  possibility  that a
responsible party might have to bear
 
                                       13
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;
more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to  obtain
appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, the Company has not had
to bear significantly more than its proportional share in multi-party situations
taken as a whole.
 
     Capital  expenditures  for  environmental  control  facilities  at existing
operations were $44 million in 1995.  The Company estimates that during each  of
the  years 1996  and 1997 such  capital expenditures will  be in the  $40 to $45
million range. In addition to capital expenditures, the Company has incurred and
will continue to incur operating costs in connection with such facilities.
 
     Reference is made to Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis at page 21 of the
Company&#39;s 1995 Annual Report to  shareowners, incorporated herein by  reference,
for further information regarding environmental matters.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The  Company had  an aggregate of  88,500 salaried and  hourly employees at
December 31, 1995. Of the  approximately 33,000 unionized employees, 19,000  are
employed  in  the  Company&#39;s  U.S. and  Canadian  plants  and  other facilities.
Unionized employees are represented by local unions that are either  independent
or  affiliated with  the United Auto  Workers, the  International Association of
Machinists, the United  Steelworkers of  America, the Oil,  Chemical and  Atomic
Workers International Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and many
other  international unions. Relations between the Company and its employees and
their various  representatives have  been generally  satisfactory, although  the
Company  has experienced work stoppages from  time to time. Approximately 39% of
the Company&#39;s  U.S.  and  Canadian  unionized employees  are  covered  by  labor
contracts  scheduled to  expire in 1996.  Major labor  negotiations will include
locations in all of the segments.
 
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
 
     The Company has 372 locations consisting of plants, research  laboratories,
sales  offices and other  facilities. The plants are  generally located to serve
large marketing areas and  to provide accessibility to  raw materials and  labor
pools.  The  properties are  generally maintained  in good  operating condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with government spending and other business
conditions; however,  no major  operating facility  is significantly  idle.  The
facilities, together with planned expansions, are expected to meet the Company&#39;s
needs  for  the  foreseeable  future. The  Company  owns  or  leases warehouses,
railroad cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and
data processing equipment.  It also  leases space for  administrative and  sales
staffs.  The Company&#39;s  headquarters and  administrative complex  are located at
Morris Township, New Jersey.

MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  AlliedSignal Inc.

1995 Compared with 1994

IN 1995 THE COMPANY DEDICATED  SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO LINKING A PROGRESSION OF
INNOVATIVE  PROCESS  IMPROVEMENTS  TO FOCUS MORE ON CUSTOMER  SATISFACTION.  The
initiatives  focus our efforts to provide our customers with a quality  product,
delivered on time,  without defects,  at a highly competitive price. The Company
continued  to grow its  businesses  through the  introduction  of new  products,
market expansion, niche acquisitions and globalization.  The Company accelerated
its aggressive global growth strategy, and international  customers provided 40%
of the  Company&#39;s  total  1995  sales.  These  process  improvements  and growth
initiatives  contributed to strong operating  results in 1995 despite  increased
customer-driven  price  constraints  and  unfavorable  results  by  Automotive&#39;s
anti-lock braking systems (ABS) business.

IN 1995 THE COMPANY TOOK FURTHER  ACTIONS TO IMPROVE  PROFITABILITY,  INTRODUCED
SEVERAL NEW PRODUCTS AND GLOBALIZED A NUMBER OF KEY BUSINESSES  THROUGH INTERNAL
GROWTH AND ACQUISITIONS:

Aerospace made a significant  contribution toward making aircraft safer with the
development  of an early warning  system for  windshear  and a ground  proximity
warning system. In addition, the Company&#39;s traffic alert and collision avoidance
system (TCAS),  initially developed for large aircraft,  had strong sales to the
regional airlines in 1995. In January 1996 the Company completed the acquisition
of Northrop Grumman Corporation&#39;s  precision products business based in Norwood,
Massachusetts.  The  acquisition,  which has annual sales of  approximately  $39
million,  is expected to bolster  Aerospace&#39;s  navigation  and guidance  systems
business  for  military  and space  applications.  During 1995 the Company  also
increased its investment in Societe D&#39;Etudes et de Constructions Aero-Navales to
83% by  purchasing an additional  34% interest in Europe&#39;s  leading  supplier of
aircraft  heat  exchange  equipment.  To  facilitate  future  growth and further
establish  a global  presence,  Aerospace  formed a joint  venture  in Russia to
market wheels,  brakes and brake systems for civilian aircraft and has agreed to
form other joint ventures in Russia and China.

Automotive,  as previously announced,  has decided to exit the light-vehicle ABS
business  and  is   conducting   discussions   concerning   the  future  of  its
light-vehicle  braking  business.  Exiting  the ABS  business  could  hinder the
Company&#39;s  ability to remain a first tier supplier of complete  braking systems.
The Company  expects that neither exiting the ABS business nor the absence of an
agreement  regarding the  light-vehicle  braking  business would have a material
impact on the Company&#39;s results of operations or financial position in 1996. See
Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information. In addition,
a  reduction  in  the  Automotive  workforce  was  announced  and  substantially
completed in the fourth quarter of 1995. The reduction eliminates  approximately
3,100 salaried and hourly  full-time-equivalent  positions and is expected to be
completed  by the end of 1996.  In  April  1995 the  Company  acquired  the Budd
Company&#39;s Wheel &amp; Brake Division (Budd Wheel &amp; Brake), which has annual sales of
more than $300 million.  In June 1995 the Company acquired Fiat Auto Poland S.A.
(Fiat)&#39;s  braking  business,  which is expected to continue to supply Fiat&#39;s two
automotive assembly facilities in Poland.  Annual sales approximate $30 million.
In October 1995  Automotive  increased to 80% its ownership in the Turkish brake
manufacturer,  Transturk Fren Donanim  Industriesi AS. Annual sales  approximate
$27  million.  Also in  1995 a new  joint  venture  began  manufacturing  hybrid
inflators  for  driver-  and  passenger-side  air bag  modules  that  are  being
assembled at the  Company&#39;s new plant in Italy.  Production  also began at a new
turbocharger plant in Shanghai, China.

Engineered  Materials purchased Hoechst AG&#39;s 95.8% interest in Riedel-de Haen AG
(Riedel-de  Haen), a German  specialty  chemicals  manufacturer in October 1995.
Riedel-de Haen  manufactures  chemicals for the  pharmaceutical  and electronics
industries,  as well as the coatings, photo dyes and specialty pigments markets.
Annual sales  approximate  $250 million.  Also in October the Company acquired a
nylon  plastics and  industrial  fibers  manufacturing  facility in  Rudolstadt,
Germany with annual sales of  approximately  $60 million.  The Company  plans to
invest about $100 million  during the next three years to expand and upgrade the
facility.  In November  1995 the  Company  acquired  Bridgestone/Firestone&#39;s  50
million-pound  industrial  polyester  fiber plant in  Hopewell,  Virginia.  With
anticipated  modernization,  the Company  believes that the Hopewell  plant will
have annual sales of  approximately  $100 million.  In December 1995 the Company
exited its high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  business.  Paxon Polymer Company,
L.P.  (Paxon),  a partnership of the Company and Exxon Chemical Company (Exxon),
transferred  the HDPE  business  to  Exxon.  See  Note 3 of  Notes to  Financial
Statements for additional information.


THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO INCREASE THE REGULAR  QUARTERLY  DIVIDEND ON THE
COMMON STOCK BY 15%, FROM $0.195 TO $0.225 PER SHARE. The dividend increase will
be effective in the first quarter of 1996. The Company had previously  increased
its regular quarterly dividend by 16% in the first quarter of 1995.

RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.  Record sales and net income were achieved again in 1995
as gains were realized in all business  segments  through growth,  strong demand
and productivity initiatives.

NET SALES in 1995 were  $14,346  million,  an increase of 12% over 1994.  Of the
$1,529 million  increase,  $613 million was the result of strong volume gains by
the  Engineered  Materials  and  Aerospace  segments  and $760  million from the
consolidation of recent  acquisitions  offset in part by a $91 million reduction
for  disposed  businesses,  $181  million  was the result of  favorable  foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the Automotive  segment and $66 million was due to
higher prices in the Engineered Materials segment.  Automotive&#39;s sales increased
$627 million, or 13%, Engineered  Materials was $441 million, or 13%, higher and
Aerospace had a $461 million, or 10%, gain.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES as a percent of net sales decreased
from 10.7% in 1994 to 10.5% in 1995.

                                                                              19

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Expenses  increased by $137  million,  or 10%,  reflecting in part the impact of
acquisitions.

INCOME FROM  OPERATIONS of $1,260  million in 1995 improved by $108 million,  or
9%, compared with last year.  Excluding the nonrecurring items in 1995 (see Note
3 of Notes to Financial  Statements  for  information),  income from  operations
improved by $152 million,  or 13%.  Engineered Materials&#39; and Aerospace&#39;s income
from  operations  both  increased  20%;  while  Automotive  had  a 1%  decrease.
Operating  margins  increased  slightly,  from 9.0% in 1994 to 9.1% in 1995, and
productivity  (the constant dollar basis  relationship of sales to costs) of the
Company&#39;s businesses increased 5.2% over last year reflecting  manufacturing and
materials  management  initiatives  and unit sales  increases.  See the detailed
discussion of net income below for information by industry segment.

EQUITY  IN INCOME OF  AFFILIATED  COMPANIES  of $191  million  increased  by $62
million,  or 48%,  compared  with last year  mainly  because of  improved  joint
venture  earnings  for Paxon,  UOP process  technology  (UOP),  Knorr-Bremse  AG
(Knorr-Bremse)&#39;s European truck brake systems and Converdyn conversion services.

OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE),  a $22 million  loss,  improved by $5 million,  or 19%,
compared with a loss of $27 million in 1994  primarily  reflecting a gain on the
sale of an  investment  and  lower  foreign  exchange  losses.  Higher  minority
interest was a partial offset.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL  CHARGES of $168 million  increased by $25 million,
or 17%, from 1994 largely due to higher average  interest rates and an increased
level of debt.

NET  INCOME  in 1995 was $875  million,  or $3.09 a share,  an  increase  of 15%
compared with $759  million,  or $2.68 a share,  for 1994.  The higher income in
1995 was the result of strong operating  performance by the Engineered Materials
and Aerospace segments and a small increase by Automotive.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS  SEGMENTS  follows.  Adjusted net
income for the Automotive and Engineered  Materials segments excludes the impact
of the 1995 nonrecurring items. (Dollars in millions)

Aerospace&#39;s sales increased 10% reflecting the acquisition of Textron&#39;s Lycoming
Turbine Engine  Division  (Lycoming  Engine) in October 1994,  continued  strong
demand  for  safety-related  commercial  avionics  systems,  such as  predictive
windshear,  ground proximity  warning,  global  positioning and TCAS, and higher
sales of auxiliary power units (APUs).  TCAS sales were  particularly  strong as
U.S.  operators of  10-to-30-seat  aircraft  complied with the Federal  Aviation
Administration&#39;s  mandate to  install  TCAS by the end of 1995.  Commercial  and
military  aftermarket  showed  strong  growth.  Equipment  Systems&#39;  repair  and
overhaul services and environmental  control systems also had higher sales. This
increase was somewhat offset by lower sales for Government  Electronics Systems,
where comparisons were adversely  affected by one-time  contract  settlements in
1994 and the closeout of certain programs.

Overall, the Company&#39;s 1995 sales to the Department of Defense (DoD), as a prime
contractor and subcontractor,  declined 7% compared with 1994 because of reduced
defense  spending.  Sales  to the  commercial  and  foreign  government  markets
increased 19%, while sales to the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) and other U.S. government agencies increased 2% in 1995. Sales to the DoD
accounted for 24% of Aerospace&#39;s  total sales, a decrease of 4 percentage points
compared with 1994.

Aerospace&#39;s net income improved 17% compared with last year.  Synergies from the
Lycoming Engine acquisition, process improvements,  organizational efficiencies,
higher sales of APUs and continued strong demand for  safety-related  Commercial
Avionics  Systems  contributed to  significantly  higher income.  Profit margins
benefited by the early product  development and marketing of the  safety-related
avionics  systems.  Strong  sales  of  higher  margin  commercial  and  military
aftermarket  products also contributed to higher income.  Equipment  Systems had
higher earnings from improved sales of environmental  control systems as well as
from  increased  repair and overhaul  business.  Earnings  related to government
services  also  improved,  but  Government  Electronic  Systems had lower income
primarily due to earnings related to one-time  contract  settlements in 1994 and
manufacturing difficulties.

The U.S.  defense  budget is  expected  to  continue  to decline for a number of
years,  but at a progressively  slower rate. A number of the Company&#39;s  military
and space programs may be stretched  out,  curtailed or canceled.  However,  the
Company does not expect that its  defense-related  sales will decline as rapidly
as the defense budget because of recent  acquisitions,  opportunities to grow in
certain  markets  and the  Company&#39;s  strong  competitive  position  on  various
programs.  The  Company&#39;s  ability to  successfully  retain and compete for such
business is highly  dependent on  continually  advancing  its  technology  base,
management procifiency, strategic alliances and cost-effective performance.

The Company  believes  that the cyclical  downturn for the  commercial  aircraft
industry  reached  bottom in 1995 and a small  improvement  is expected in 1996.
Regional  airline  traffic  continues  to grow  significantly  and new  regional
aircraft  orders were higher in 1995. The commercial  aftermarket  showed strong
growth during 1995.

The Company  continues  to receive  significant  contracts  from the  commercial
aviation industry, DoD and NASA and earnings are expected to remain strong.

At December  31,  1995 and 1994 the  Company  had firm orders for its  aerospace
products  from the U.S. and foreign  governments  of $1,871 and $1,803  million,
respectively.  Total backlog,  including commercial contracts,  at year-end 1995
and 1994 was $4,523 and $4,730 million,  respectively.  The Company  anticipates
that  approximately  $3,010  million  of the total 1995  backlog  will be filled
during 1996.

Automotive&#39;s sales were up 13% compared with 1994 reflecting improvements in all
major business units.  Automotive&#39;s sales benefited from the acquisition of Budd
Wheel &amp; Brake as well as growing demand for braking systems in Europe.  Although
North American  vehicle  production  volumes  decreased  slightly in 1995, North

increased as a result of key business  wins with the Ford Motor  Company  (Ford)
and the Chrysler  Corporation  (Chrysler).  ABS sales were  significantly  lower
during the year. The acquisition of the seat belt business of the General Safety
Corporation in late 1994 resulted in significant sales gains.  Safety restraints
also  experienced  increased sales due to higher air bag demand in North America
and the  startup  of an air bag  plant  in  Italy.  European  spark  plug  sales
increased  largely due to the  acquisition  of a spark plug plant in the U.K. in
1994.  Record  production levels of heavy trucks translated into increased sales
for North American truck braking systems and turbochargers.  The continuation of
the trend toward  producing  diesel-powered  cars in Europe and penetration into
the Asian market also favorably impacted turbocharger sales. Turbocharger plants
continue to operate at capacity  levels.  The segments  sales  improvement  also
reflects the impact of favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations.


Automotive&#39;s  adjusted net income  improved by 1% compared with 1994. Net income
was  substantially  higher  for North  American  safety  restraints  principally
reflecting materials management and operational initiatives and for the European
aftermarket  largely  due to cost  savings,  improved  distribution  and pricing
improvements.  Turbochargers and truck braking systems had significantly  higher
income on strong sales growth.  In addition,  turbochargers  experienced  higher
operating  margins  due  to  operational   excellence  and  other  manufacturing
initiatives.  Rapid growth in the European turbodiesel  passenger car market and
growth  initiatives in the  Asia/Pacific  region have strained our  turbocharger
manufacturing  capacity.  Process  improvements  and  a  planned  expansion  are
expected to alleviate the capacity  constraints.  Offsets  included  significant
losses  for ABS and  reduced  profit  margins  on North  American  light-vehicle
braking systems.

Engineered  Materials sales increased 13% compared with 1994.  Sales were higher
for all Engineered Materials  business units,  especially polymers,  performance
materials  and  laminate  systems.   In  the  polymers   business,   sales  were
significantly higher because of price improvement for intermediate chemicals and
increased  sales  volumes and prices for  industrial  polyester,  especially  in
Europe.  Plastics had strong sales growth in all product  lines.  Carpet  fibers
experienced  price  pressure and lower volumes  throughout the fourth quarter of
1995 as the industry attempted to correct high levels of inventory.  Performance
materials  had  substantially   higher  sales  reflecting   increased  sales  of
performance  additives,   advanced  microelectronic  materials  and  performance
chemicals,  in part  reflecting the  acquisition of Riedel-de Haen in late 1995.
Laminate systems had  significantly  higher sales volumes mainly in the U.S. and
Asia/Pacific region.

















Engineered  Materials&#39;  adjusted net income increased 22% compared with the same
period last year. Net income was  substantially  higher for polymers as a result
of price  improvement for intermediate  chemicals and increased sales volume and
prices for plastics and higher sales  volumes of  industrial  polyester  fibers.
Carpet  fibers and textile  nylon also had higher  income  largely the result of
productivity  improvements.  Performance materials improved substantially due to
higher sales of performance  chemicals and advanced  microelectronic  materials.
Uranium ore processing  operations  also improved.  Laminate  systems had higher
income  on  significantly  higher  sales.  Environmental  catalysts  and  carbon
materials  also had income gains.  There was also a substantial  increase in net
income from the Paxon and UOP joint  ventures.  Fluorine  products  had slightly
lower net income,  in part because of lower selling prices and costs  associated
with the transition to mandated chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes in the U.S.
and other developed  countries.  Income from CFC substitutes  was  higher as the
Company&#39;s  proprietary  refrigerants gained acceptance among  original equipment
(OE) manufacturers.


REGARDING  ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS,  the  Company is subject to various  federal,
state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment.  The
Company  believes  that,  as a  general  matter,  its  policies,  practices  and
procedures are properly  designed to prevent  unreasonable risk of environmental
damage and that its  handling,  manufacture,  use and  disposal of  hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations. However,
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor  companies,  the
Company,  like other  companies  engaged in  similar  businesses,  is a party to
lawsuits and claims and has incurred  remedial  response and  voluntary  cleanup

mental  matters.  Additional lawsuits,  claims and costs involving environmental
matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.  The  Company continually
conducts studies,  individually at Company-owned sites, and jointly as a  member
of industry groups at non-owned  sites, to determine  the feasibility of various
remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is the Company&#39;s policy
to   record   appropriate   liabilities   for  such  matters  when environmental
assessments  are  made  or remedial  efforts are  probable  and the costs can be
reasonably  estimated.  The  timing  of  these  accruals  is  generally  on  the
completion of feasibility  studies or the settlement of claims,  but in no event
later than the Company&#39;s commitment to a plan of action.

Remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures were $72 and $66 million in
1995  and  1994,  respectively,  and are  currently  estimated  to  increase  to
approximately  $90 million in 1996.  While annual  expenditures  have  generally
increased from year to year, and may continue to increase over time, the Company
expects  it will  be  able  to  fund  such  expenditures  from  cash  flow  from
operations. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors, including
regulatory approval of cleanup projects,  remedial techniques to be utilized and
agreements with other parties.

During 1995 the Company  charged $25 million  against pretax income for remedial
response  and  voluntary  cleanup  costs.  At  December  31,  1995 the  recorded
liability for environmental  matters was $454 million. In addition,  in 1995 the
Company incurred  operating costs for ongoing  businesses of  approximately  $85
million and capital  expenditures  of $44 million  relating to  compliance  with
environmental regulations.

Although  the Company  does not  currently  possess  sufficient  information  to
reasonably  estimate  the  amounts of  liabilities  to be  recorded  upon future
completion of studies or  settlements,  and neither the timing nor the amount of
the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
may  be  significant  to  the  Company&#39;s  consolidated  results  of  operations.
Management  does not  expect  that  environmental  matters  will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.

See Note 19 of Notes to Financial  Statements  for a discussion of the Company&#39;s
commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters.

REGARDING  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS,  the Company,  with  operating  and financing
activities in numerous  countries and sales  throughout the world, is exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency  exchange rates. The Company
manages exposure to changes in interest rates through its regular  borrowing and
investing  decisions and, when deemed  appropriate,  through the use of interest
rate swap  agreements.  The  objective  of such risk  management  activity is to
minimize the cost of the Company&#39;s  debt  financing  over an extended  period of
time.  The Company  manages  exposure  to foreign  currency  exchange  rates for
transactional  items by  matching  and  offsetting  assets and  liabilities  and
thereafter  through  financial hedge  contracts with third parties.  The Company
does not use financial  instruments for trading or other  speculative  purposes.
See  Note 15 of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further  information  on
financial instruments.

INFLATION  has not been a  significant  factor  for the  Company  in a number of
years.  Cost  increases for labor and material have  generally been low, and any
impact has been offset by productivity enhancement programs, including materials
management.

THE  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  BOARD (FASB)  issued  Statement No. 121 -
&#34;Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets to Be Disposed Of&#34; (FASB No.
121),  effective for 1996. The Company is completing an analysis of FASB No. 121
which is not  expected  to have a material  impact on the  Company&#39;s  results of
operations or financial position.

The FASB issued  Statement No. 123 - &#34;Accounting for  Stock-based  Compensation&#34;
(FASB No. 123),  which is also effective for 1996. The Company plans to continue
to account for stock  compensation  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the
Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 -  &#34;Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees&#34;,  and will provide the pro-forma disclosures required by FASB No. 123
in the notes to the 1996 financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION.  Significant improvement in operating cash flows and strong
earnings  growth  resulted in continued  improvement in the Company&#39;s  financial
condition.

TOTAL ASSETS at December 31, 1995 were  $12,465  million,  an increase of $1,144
million from  December 31, 1994,  primarily due to  acquisitions.  Cash and cash
equivalents  at  year-end  1995 were $540  million,  an  increase of $32 million
compared with

22


&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;

December  31,  1994.  Cash flows from  operating  activities  increased  by $173
million,  or  17%,  because  of  improved  earnings  and  lower  trade  accounts
receivable,  partially  offset  by  higher  inventories  to meet  the  Company&#39;s
increased  sales  level.  The  current  ratio at  year-end  1995 was 1.3x,  down
slightly from 1.4x last year. The Company&#39;s  working  capital  turnover was also
down slightly to 5.2x at December 31, 1995 from 5.5x a year earlier.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING  available under the Company&#39;s  revolving credit
agreements (Credit Agreements) was reduced by the Company in June 1995 from $900
million to $750 million  because the floating rate Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) notes were  refinanced in 1995 and are no longer  supported by the Credit
Agreements.  The Credit  Agreements  support the issuance of  commercial  paper.
There was $58 million of commercial  paper  outstanding  at year-end 1995 and no
commercial  paper  outstanding at the end of 1994.  Commercial  paper  borrowing
reached a high of $900 million during 1995.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end 1995 of $2,010 million  increased $323 million  primarily
as a result  of  increased  short-term  borrowing  mainly  due to  acquisitions.
Long-term debt of $1,366 million was reduced by $58 million during the year. The
Company&#39;s  total debt as a percent of capital  was 33.7% at December  31,  1995,
down  from  34.1% at  year-end  1994.  Long-term  debt to  capital  was 25.6% at
year-end  1995,  down  from  30.4%  at  year-end  1994.  See Note 13 of Notes to
Financial  Statements  for details of  long-term  debt and a  discussion  of the
Credit Agreements.

THE COMPANY  REPURCHASED  5.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $239 million in
1995.  Common stock was  repurchased in 1995 to meet expected  requirements  for
shares  issued  under   employee   benefit  plans  and  a  shareowner   dividend
reinvestment  plan.  At year-end  1995 the Company  had 75.5  million  shares of
common stock held in treasury carried at $1,658 million. As of year-end 1995 the
Company was authorized to repurchase 8.1 million shares of common stock.

CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES during 1995 were $746 million, an increase of $107 million
from the $639 million  spent in 1994,  mainly due to capacity  expansions in the
Engineered Materials segment.  Spending by the segments and Corporate since 1993
is shown  in Note 23 of  Notes to  Financial  Statements.  The  Company&#39;s  total
capital  expenditures  in 1996 are  currently  projected at about $765  million.
These  expenditures  are expected to be financed by internally  generated funds.
Approximately  67% of the projected 1996  expenditures are planned for expansion
and cost reduction, 27% for replacement and maintenance and 6% for environmental
projects.

1994 COMPARED WITH 1993

IN 1994  THE  COMPANY  DEVELOPED  NEW  INITIATIVES  TO  IMPROVE  EFFICIENCY  AND
ELIMINATE WASTE,  SHARPEN ITS FOCUS ON CUSTOMER  SATISFACTION AND TARGET FOREIGN
GROWTH  OPPORTUNITIES.  PRODUCTIVITY  PROGRAMS  STARTED SINCE 1991  CONTINUED TO
ENHANCE AND GROW THE BUSINESS.  One new  initiative -  Operational  Excellence -
will enhance productivity  programs by redesigning the Company&#39;s basic processes
to remove variations and improve manufacturing yields as well as by implementing
measurement  tools to  monitor  our  progress.  Another  initiative  -  Customer
Partnerships  - involves  customers in designing the Company&#39;s  products,  while
reducing cycle times in  engineering,  manufacturing  and product  support.  The
Company will start training  employees in 1995 in Total Quality Leadership Phase
II to provide  natural work teams with  analytical  tools for achieving  process
improvements.

DURING 1994 THE COMPANY LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IN 1995 AND BEYOND:

Aerospace acquired Lycoming Engine in October 1994. This acquisition extends the
Engines group&#39;s product offerings in the robust regional aircraft market as well
as into helicopter and other  commercial and military  applications  for turbine
engines. To reduce costs and improve  competitiveness in its core product lines,
Aerospace  consolidated 12 businesses into four integrated  units and merged its
sales and service  organizations into a single group.  During the year Aerospace
introduced new high-technology products to enhance flight safety and also agreed
to form a number of strategic  alliances  in Japan and China to better  position
itself as a global supplier and to secure a share of the fast-growing markets in
the Asia/Pacific region.

Globalization is also a key factor in Automotive&#39;s growth strategy.  The Company
acquired Ford&#39;s spark plug plant in the U.K.,  which had 1993 sales of about $20
million,  and a seat belt manufacturer in Italy,  owned by the Fiat Group, which
had annual sales of approximately $34 million.  Automotive began construction of
a $27 million  turbocharger plant in Shanghai,  China and has entered into joint
venture  agreements  to  produce  air bag  inflators  in  Italy,  to  distribute
aftermarket  products  throughout Europe and to supply brake boosters from Spain
for vehicles  built in Europe by Japanese  manufacturers.  In November  1994 the
Company  acquired  the seat belt  business  of  General  Safety  Corporation,  a
supplier to General Motors  Corporation and Ford.  General Safety had 1994 sales
of about $95 million.

Engineered Materials began manufacturing  environmentally-safer  alternatives to
CFCs at a new $70 million facility in Geismar,  Louisiana and acquired the small
CFC business of Akzo N.V. in the  Netherlands.  A joint venture  agreement  with
General Motors to produce coated automotive  catalytic converter  substrates was
signed  in  November   1994.   The  venture   strengthens   the  technology  and
manufacturing capacity of both companies.

RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.  The  Company&#39;s  sales and  earnings  expanded to record
levels in 1994.  The Company  grew through new product  introductions  and niche
acquisitions  and by gaining  market  share in an expanding  worldwide  economy.
Internal   restructuring   and   productivity    improvements   drove   earnings
significantly higher.

NET SALES in 1994 were $12,817 million, an increase of 8% over last year. Of the
$990 million increase, $880 million was the result of strong volume gains by the
Automotive  and  Engineered   Materials  segments  and  $442  million  from  the
consolidation of recent acquisitions, offset in part by a $163 million reduction
for  disposed  businesses,  $131  million  due to  lower  prices  mainly  in the
Automotive  segment  and  $38  million  due  to  unfavorable   foreign  exchange
fluctuations.

INCOME FROM  OPERATIONS of $1,152  million in 1994 improved by $198 million,  or
21%.  Excluding the nonrecurring items in 1993 (see Note 3 of Notes to Financial
Statements for information), income from operations improved by $214 million, or
23%.  Aerospace&#39;s income increased 12%; Automotive was 17% higher and Engineered
Materials had a 30% gain.  Operating margins increased from 7.9% in 1993 to 9.0%
in 1994 and  productivity  increased by 6.2% over last year reflecting  business
consoli-

                                                                              23

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;

dations, cycle time reductions,  materials management initiatives and unit sales
increases.  See the detailed  discussion of net income below for  information by
industry segment.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE),  a $27 million loss,  compares with a loss of $9 million
in 1993 reflecting higher minority interest as a result of the formation in late
1993 of a venture  with a  subsidiary  of  Knorr-Bremse  in the U.S. and reduced
interest  income from  investments  in short-term  securities.  Reduced  foreign
exchange costs on forward contracts had a favorable impact.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL  CHARGES of $143 million  decreased by $14 million,
or 9%, from 1993 because of refunding a number of debt issues at lower  interest
rates and a reduced level of outstanding debt. Higher interest rates on floating
rate borrowings partially offset such savings.

THE  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE in 1994 was 31.7%  compared with 27.9% in 1993.  The 3.8
percentage  point increase in 1994 was due to a higher level of earnings subject
to the U.S. statutory rate, additional  non-deductible  expenses in 1994 and the
absence   of  the   favorable   impact   of  a  rate   increase   on  the   1993
beginning-of-the-year deferred tax balances as a result of the 1993 Tax Act. See
Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information.

INCOME BEFORE THE  CUMULATIVE  EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN AN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE of
$759 million,  or $2.68 a share,  in 1994 increased by $103 million,  or $0.37 a
share, compared with $656 million, or $2.31 a share, last year.

NET  INCOME  in 1994 was $759  million,  or $2.68 a share,  compared  with  $411
million,  or  $1.45 a  share,  for  1993.  However,  1993  was  impacted  by the
cumulative effect of adopting an accounting  change of $245 million,  or $0.86 a
share.  The  higher  income  in  1994  was  the  result  of a  strong  operating
performance by all segments.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS  SEGMENTS,  before the cumulative
impact of an  accounting  change on net  income,  follows.  Adjusted  net income
excludes the impact of the 1993 nonrecurring items. (Dollars in millions)

Aerospace&#39;s  sales increased 2% over last year. The acquisitions of the Lycoming
Engine and Sundstrand Data Control operations and contract  settlements with the
U.S.  Air Force  contributed  significantly  to the higher  sales.  The regional
airline  market  continued  to grow,  but a reduction  in military  spending and
weakness in the commercial  aircraft  market  continued to restrict  sales.  The
Engines group had lower sales of spares and repair and overhaul  services to the
aftermarket. Government Electronic Systems had lower sales of avionics equipment
to the military.  Equipment  Systems had reduced  commercial and military sales,
but sales from aircraft  landing  systems&#39;  repair and overhaul  operations were
higher, in part reflecting new business.  Commercial  Avionics Systems had lower
sales  mainly of TCAS II,  reflecting  the  completion  of the airline  industry
retrofit  program.  Sales were reduced by the mid-year 1994  dispositions of the
actuation and hangar businesses.


Overall,  the  Company&#39;s  1994  sales  to the  DoD,  as a prime  contractor  and
subcontractor,  declined by 7%  compared  with 1993  because of reduced  defense
spending.  Sales to the commercial and foreign  government  markets increased by
5%, while sales to NASA and other U.S.  government  agencies increased by 13% in
1994. Sales to the DoD accounted for 28% of Aerospace&#39;s  total sales, a decrease
of 3 percentage points compared with 1993.

Although  sales were up only  slightly,  Aerospace&#39;s  net income  increased  14%
compared  with last year&#39;s  adjusted  net income.  Cost  savings  from  business
consolidations, materials management and other productivity programs, especially
in the Engines group,  contributed to significantly  higher income.  The Engines
group also had lower  engineering  expense on certain  major  programs that were
winding down.  Government  Electronic Systems had favorable contract settlements
and Equipment  Systems had higher income from  commercial  aftermarket  sales of
aircraft landing systems. The benefits from the productivity programs offset the
continued  contraction  of military  spending  and  softness  in the  commercial
aircraft market.

At December  31,  1994 and 1993 the  Company  had firm orders for its  aerospace
products  from the U.S. and foreign  governments  of $1,803 and $1,861  million,
respectively.  Total backlog,  including commercial contracts,  at year-end 1994
and 1993 was $4,730 and $4,773 million, respectively.

Automotive&#39;s  sales  were up 9%  compared  with 1993.  Demand was  substantially
higher for  braking  systems,  turbochargers  and safety  restraints.  Strong OE
markets and new product  introductions  increased  sales for North  American and
European  brakes and air bags.  Sales of ABS increased in 1994,  reflecting  new
business with Ford and Chrysler due in part to the introduction of the Company&#39;s
advanced   traction   control  system.   Hybrid  inflator   technology   spurred
significantly  higher  sales of air bag  systems.  Strong  diesel truck sales in
North  America  and  greater  demand  for  diesel-powered  cars in Europe led to
significantly  higher  turbocharger  sales.   Turbocharger  plants  operated  at
capacity to satisfy the heavy demand. North American truck brake systems,  which
benefited  from strong OE medium and heavy truck demand,  had  increased  sales.
Sales of European truck brake systems are no longer consolidated,  following the
1993 venture with Knorr-Bremse.

Automotive&#39;s  adjusted  net income  increased  16%  reflecting  higher sales for
turbochargers,  braking  systems,  truck brakes and air bags. OE sales were very
strong in the North American market, and European businesses strengthened due to
the economic turnaround  occurring mainly in France and Spain. Income growth was
limited  by  temporary  capacity  constraints  in  the  turbocharger   business.
Productivity  improvements,   plant  rationalization  and  materials  management
throughout the segment also contributed to the significantly higher earnings.

Engineered Materials&#39; sales increased 17% because of strong automotive, housing,
industrial and electronics markets. Higher

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;

sales volumes of industrial  and carpet fibers also reflect  shipments  from the
new polyester  facility in France and the acquisition of a carpet nylon business
in Europe.  Laminates grew  significantly  through  continued  globalization and
market   share    gains.    Fluorine    products    had   improved    sales   of
environmentally-safer  CFC  substitutes as additional  capacity was added during
the year and as a result of recent  acquisitions.  Environmental  catalysts  had
strong  sales to the OE  automotive  industry.  Plastics had higher sales to the
automotive,  packaging and distributor markets.  Amorphous metals expanded sales
to the article surveillance and transformer markets.

Adjusted net income for Engineered  Materials was up 20% reflecting higher sales
volumes for all  businesses  as well as  operating  efficiencies.  The  laminate
systems  business had strong earnings on  substantially  higher sales.  Fluorine
products had higher income reflecting increased CFC substitute capacity and cost
reductions,  although pricing  pressures  limited gains.  The amorphous  metals,
performance  chemicals and uranium hexafluoride  businesses had increased income
on higher sales. Carpet and industrial fibers had substantially  higher earnings
on increased  sales  volumes and prices,  but these gains were mostly  offset by
higher raw material  costs and by start-up  costs at the  Longlaville  facility.
Higher profit contributions were also realized from Engineered  Materials&#39; joint
ventures - Paxon and UOP.

REGARDING  ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS,   remedial  response  and  voluntary  cleanup
expenditures were $66 and $65 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

During 1994 the Company  charged $37 million  against pretax income for remedial
response  and  voluntary  cleanup  costs.  At  December  31,  1994 the  recorded
liability for environmental  matters was $494 million. In addition,  the Company
incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $80 million and
capital  expenditures of $43 million  relating to compliance with  environmental
regulations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $1 billion for
the third consecutive  year,  allowing the Company to continue to invest heavily
in its growth initiatives - particularly acquisitions and increases in capacity.
Additional  working capital  investment  required to support the Company&#39;s sales
growth  during 1994  impacted  further  cash flow  improvements.  High levels of
operating  cash flow,  together  with major debt  repayments  and  increases  in
retained  earnings have resulted in a significant  improvement  in the Company&#39;s
financial position in recent years.

TOTAL  ASSETS at December  31, 1994 were  $11,321  million,  an increase of $492
million from December 31, 1993. Cash and cash  equivalents at year-end 1994 were
$508 million, a decrease of $384 million compared with December 31, 1993, mainly
reflecting the  acquisitions of Lycoming  Engine and General Safety.  Cash flows
from operating  activities  decreased by $137 million because of higher accounts
receivable  reflecting the Company&#39;s increased sales level. The current ratio at
year-end  1994 was 1.4x,  compared with 1.3x last year.  The  Company&#39;s  working
capital turnover improved to 5.5x at December 31, 1994 from 4.8x a year earlier.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING  available under the Company&#39;s Credit Agreements
was $900 million. The Credit Agreements support the issuance of commercial paper
as well as outstanding  floating rate ESOP notes.  There was no commercial paper
outstanding  at year-end  1994 and $164  million at the end of 1993.  Commercial
paper  borrowing  reached a high of $516 million during 1994.  Outstanding  ESOP
notes, at favorable  floating  interest rates,  totaled $217 and $259 million at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end  1994 was $1,687  million,  a decrease  of $273  million,
primarily  as a result of paying down  commercial  paper and a  redemption  of a
deutsche  mark bond  issue.  Long-term  debt was  reduced by $178  million.  The
Company&#39;s  total debt as a percent of capital  was 34.1% at December  31,  1994,
down  from  42.7% at  year-end  1993.  Long-term  debt to  capital  was 30.4% at
year-end  1994,  down  from  37.9%  at  year-end  1993.  See Note 13 of Notes to
Financial  Statements  for details of  long-term  debt and a  discussion  of the
Credit Agreements.

THE COMPANY  REPURCHASED  2.9 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $103 million in
1994.  Common stock was  repurchased in 1994 to meet expected  requirements  for
shares  issued  under   employee   benefit  plans  and  a  shareowner   dividend
reinvestment  plan.  At year-end the Company had 75.1  million  shares of common
stock held in treasury carried at $1,505 million.

CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES  during 1994 were $639 million,  a decrease of $79 million
from the $718 million  spent in 1993.  Spending by the  segments  and  Corporate
since 1993 is shown in Note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Notes to Financial Statements   AlliedSignal Inc.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)

Note 1
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ALLIEDSIGNAL INC. is a global,  advanced  technology and manufacturing  company.
The  Company&#39;s  principal  lines  of  business  are  aerospace,  automotive  and
engineered materials (chemicals,  fibers, plastics and advanced materials).  The
principal markets for aerospace  products are the U.S. and foreign  governments,
aircraft  manufacturers,  commercial  airlines and dealers and  distributors  of
general   aviation   products.   Automotive   products  are  sold  to  worldwide
manufacturers  of passenger  cars,  light,  medium and heavy  trucks,  buses and
off-highway  vehicles and the  independent  aftermarket and passenger  car/truck
dealers.   Engineered   materials  have  applications  for  numerous  industries
including  automotive,  carpeting,  refrigeration,   construction,  electronics,
computer and utilities, among others.

CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS include the accounts of AlliedSignal Inc. and
majority-owned   subsidiaries.   The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

INVENTORIES  are  valued  at the  lower of cost or  market  using  the  last-in,
first-out  (LIFO) method for certain  qualifying  domestic  inventories  and the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method for other inventories.

INVESTMENTS  AND  LONG-TERM  RECEIVABLES  are carried at market value if readily
determinable or cost. Investments in affiliates over which significant influence
is exercised are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT are carried at cost and are generally depreciated
using estimated service lives, which range from 3 to 40 years. For the financial
statements, depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method.

COST IN EXCESS OF NET  ASSETS OF  ACQUIRED  COMPANIES  is being  amortized  on a
straight-line  basis over  appropriate  periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. The
cumulative  amount of goodwill  amortized  at December 31, 1995 and 1994 is $407
and $358 million, respectively.

POSTEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS for former or inactive employees,  excluding retirement
benefits,  are  accounted  for  under the  provisions  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards   Board  (FASB)   Statement  No.   112--&#34;Employers&#39;   Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits&#34; (FASB No. 112), effective January 1, 1993. FASB No. 112
requires  the  Company  to  accrue  the  cost  of  certain  benefits,  including
severance,  workers&#39;  compensation and health care coverage,  over an employee&#39;s
service life. A one-time charge for the adoption of FASB No. 112 of $396 million
(after-tax  $245 million,  or $0.86 a share) was  recognized  as the  cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in 1993. The 1993 ongoing expense was
$18 million  (after-tax  $11  million,  or $0.04 a share).  The Company uses the
services of an enrolled actuary to calculate  postemployment  costs. The Company
previously  expensed  the  cost of such  benefits  on a  pay-as-you-go  basis or
recognized the impact at the time of a specific event.

RECOGNITION  OF CONTRACT  REVENUES  primarily  relates to Aerospace  operations.
Under fixed-price contracts,  sales and related costs are recorded as deliveries
are made. Sales and related costs under cost-reimbursable contracts are recorded
as costs are  incurred.  Anticipated  future  losses on contracts are charged to
income when  identified.  Contracts which are part of a program are evaluated on
an overall program basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL  expenditures  that relate to current  operations  are expensed or
capitalized as appropriate.  Expenditures  that relate to an existing  condition
caused by past  operations,  and which do not  contribute  to  current or future
revenue  generation,  are expensed.  Liabilities are recorded when environmental
assessments  are made or  remedial  efforts  are  probable  and the costs can be
reasonably  estimated.  The  timing  of  these  accruals  is  generally  on  the
completion of feasibility  studies or the settlement of claims,  but in no event
later than the Company&#39;s  commitment to a plan of action.  The  liabilities  for
environmental  costs recorded in Accrued  Liabilities  and Other  Liabilities at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 were $90 and $364  million and $78 and $416  million,
respectively.

INTEREST  RATE AND FOREIGN  CURRENCY  FORWARD,  OPTION AND SWAP  AGREEMENTS  are
accounted for as a hedge of the related  asset,  liability,  firm  commitment or
anticipated  transaction when designated and effective as a hedge of such items.
Agreements qualifying for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:

  Changes  in the  amount  to be  received  or paid  under  interest  rate  swap
  agreements are recognized in Interest and Other Financial Charges.

  Gains and  losses on  foreign  currency  agreements  used to hedge  assets and
  liabilities,  or net  investments in foreign  subsidiaries,  are recognized in
  Other Income (Expense) or Cumulative Foreign Exchange Translation  Adjustment,
  respectively.

  Gains and losses on foreign  currency  agreements  used to hedge firm  foreign
  currency  commitments,  and purchased  foreign  currency options used to hedge
  anticipated foreign currency  transactions,  are recognized in the measurement
  of the hedged transaction when the transaction occurs.

Changes in the fair value of agreements not qualifying for hedge  accounting are
recognized in Other Income (Expense).

The  carrying  value  of each  agreement  is  reported  in  Accounts  and  Notes
Receivable,  Other Current Assets,  Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities,  as
appropriate.

INCOME  TAXES  are  based on the  asset and  liability  approach.  Deferred  tax
liabilities  or assets  reflect  the  impact of  temporary  differences  between
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting.  Such amounts
are  subsequently  adjusted,  as  appropriate,  to reflect  changes in tax rates
expected to be in effect when the temporary  differences  reverse.   A valuation
allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not
likely.  Deferred  income  taxes have not been  provided on  approximately  $278
million of  undistributed  earnings of foreign  affiliated  companies  which are
considered
                                                                              29


&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;



to be permanently  reinvested.  Any U.S. taxes payable on foreign earnings which
may be remitted, however, will be substantially offset by foreign tax credits.

ACQUISITIONS

In 1995 the Company  acquired The Budd  Company&#39;s  Wheel &amp; Brake  Division (Budd
Wheel &amp; Brake)  for  approximately  $160  million  in cash.  Budd  Wheel &amp; Brake
manufactures  rotors,  hubs, drums and related assemblies for passenger cars and
light trucks; steel disc wheels for heavy trucks;  demountable rims; and hub and
drum  assemblies for medium- and heavy-duty  vehicles and had 1994 sales of over
$300 million.  In addition,  the Company  acquired a 95.8% interest in Riedel-de
Haen AG from  Hoechst  AG for  $245  million  in  cash.  Riedel-de  Haen AG is a
specialty chemicals manufacturer located in Germany. The business had 1994 sales
of approximately $250 million.

In 1994 the Company  acquired the Lycoming  Turbine  Engine  Division of Textron
Inc.  (Lycoming  Engine) for $375 million in cash and the  assumption of certain
liabilities. During 1995 the Company received $28 million in final settlement of
the purchase price. The business had 1994 sales of $550 million. Lycoming Engine
manufactures  turbofan  engines for regional  airlines,  helicopter  engines for
commercial,  military  and utility  aircraft,  military  tank engines and marine
propulsion engines.

In 1993 the Company acquired the data control business of Sundstrand Corporation
(Data Controls) for $195 million in cash. The business had sales of $194 million
in 1992.  Data  Controls  manufactures  a wide range of avionics  such as ground
proximity warning systems, reactive windshear detection systems, flight data and
voice recorders, general aviation in-flight phone systems and aircraft condition
monitoring systems.

The Company also made a number of smaller acquisitions in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NONRECURRING ITEMS

The 1995  nonrecurring  items consist of a provision of $115 million  (after-tax
$71 million,  or $0.25 a share)  relating to  management&#39;s  decision to exit the
anti-lock  braking  systems  (ABS) business.   The  provision  consists  of  the
revaluation  of the  Company&#39;s ABS assets to their fair market value and certain
other  closure  costs.  Also  included is a gain of $71 million  (after-tax  $71
million,  or $0.25 a share)  from the  transfer  of the assets of the  Company&#39;s
high-density  polyethylene (HDPE) business joint venture, Paxon Polymer Company,
L.P. (Paxon), to Exxon Chemical Company (Exxon).

The 1993  nonrecurring  items  consist of a gain of $89 million  (after-tax  $50
million,  or $0.17 a share) from the  formation of an alliance of the  Company&#39;s
air-brake control and related product  operations for heavy trucks with those of
Knorr-Bremse  AG, partly offset by a provision  totaling $73 million  (after-tax
$49 million, or $0.17 a share) covering  transaction and other costs,  including
formation costs, relating to Knorr-Bremse and other business ventures as well as
the cost of several legal actions.

expiration  rules.  The U.S.  capital  loss is  available  to offset  income tax
payments on capital gains through 1997.

The Company is a party to agreements under which it can sell undivided interests
in designated  pools of trade  accounts  receivable up to $500 million  (average
outstanding  was $500 million during 1995 and 1994).  New  receivables  are sold
under the agreements as previously sold  receivables are collected.  During 1995
this  represented  an average  collection  period of 47 days or a replacement of
receivables  of  approximately  eight times.  At both December 31, 1995 and 1994
customer accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been reduced
by $500  million  reflecting  such sales.  The Company  acts as an agent for the
purchasers in the collection and administration of the receivables.

(1) Amounts are net of repurchases.

The Company has two credit  agreements  (Credit  Agreements)  with a group of 21
banks (Five-Year and 364-Day Credit  Agreements)  with  commitments  aggregating
$750 million.  The funds available  under the Credit  Agreements may be used for
any corporate  purpose.  Loans under the $375 million Five-Year Credit Agreement
are required to be repaid no later than June 30, 2000. Annually, the Company may
request  that the  maturity of the  Five-Year  Credit  Agreement  be extended by
another year.  The Company  intends to request an extension of this agreement in
1996.  The banks&#39;  commitments  to lend under the $375  million  364-Day  Credit
Agreement  terminate on June 28, 1996. The Company  intends to renegotiate  this
agreement  in 1996.  The Company has agreed to pay  facility  fees of 0.095% per
annum and 0.065% per annum on the  aggregate  commitments  for the Five-Year and
364-Day Credit Agreements,  respectively, subject to increase or decrease on the
Five-Year  Agreement  in the event of changes in the  Company&#39;s  long-term  debt
ratings.  The Credit  Agreements  do not restrict the  Company&#39;s  ability to pay
dividends or require the Company to maintain a specific net worth. However, they
do contain other customary conditions and events of default, the failure to com-


32

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;


ply with, or occurrence of, which would prevent any further borrowings and would
generally  require the  repayment  of any  outstanding  borrowings  under either
Credit  Agreement.  Such conditions  include the absence of any material adverse
change in the ability of the Company to pay its indebtedness  when due, and such
events of default include (a) non-payment of Credit  Agreement debt and interest
thereon,  (b) non-compliance with the terms of the covenants,  (c) cross-default
with other debt in certain  circumstances,  (d) bankruptcy and (e) defaults upon
obligations  under the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act.  Additionally,
each of the banks has the right to terminate  its  commitment  to lend under the
Credit Agreements if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30% or
more of the Company&#39;s voting stock or during any 12-month period individuals who
were  directors  of  the  Company  at the  beginning  of  the  period  cease  to
constitute a majority of the Board of Directors (the Board).

Interest on borrowings under the Credit  Agreements would be determined,  at the
Company&#39;s  option, by (a) an auction bidding  procedure;  (b) the highest of the
floating  base rate of the agent bank,  0.5% above the average CD rate,  or 0.5%
above the  Federal  funds  rate;  or (c) a spread  (equal to 15.5 and 18.5 basis
points for the Five-Year and 364-Day Credit Agreements,  respectively), over the
average  Eurocurrency  rate of  three  reference  banks.  The  spread  over  the
Eurocurrency rate on the Five-Year  Agreement is subject to increase or decrease
if the  Company&#39;s  long-term  debt  ratings  change.  The Company had no balance
outstanding  under the  Credit  Agreements  at  December  31,  1995.  The Credit
Agreements presently serve as support for the issuance of commercial paper.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company,  as a result of its global operating and financing  activities,  is
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign  currency  exchange rates which
may adversely  affect its results of  operations  and  financial  condition.  In
seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities,  the
Company  manages  exposure  to changes in interest  rates and  foreign  currency
exchange rates through its regular operating and financing  activities and, when
deemed appropriate,  through the use of derivative  financial  instruments.  The
instruments  utilized include forward,  option and swap agreements.  The Company
does not use financial  instruments for trading or other  speculative  purposes.
The Company had no leveraged financial instruments at December 31, 1995.

At December 31, 1995 the Company held  interest  rate swap  agreements  maturing
through  the year 2000.  At  December  31, 1995  interest  rate swap  agreements
effectively  changed $300 million of  fixed-rate  debt  (average  9.53%) to U.S.
commercial paper based floating rate debt (average 8.24%). Based on their terms,
these agreements will be terminated by the  counterparty if short-term  interest
rates  drop  below  a  predetermined  level.   Additional  interest  rate  swaps
effectively  changed $74 million of London  Interbank  Offer Rate (LIBOR)  based
floating  rate debt  (average  5.26%) to fixed  rate debt  (average  6.92%).  At
December 31, 1994 interest rate swap agreements  effectively changed $82 million
of LIBOR based  floating rate debt  (average  5.21%) to fixed rate debt (average
7.12%).

The Company&#39;s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from
intercompany  loans  utilized  to  finance  foreign  subsidiaries,  receivables,
payables and firm  commitments  arising  from  international  transactions.  The
Company  attempts to have all such  transaction  exposures  hedged with internal
natural  offsets to the fullest  extent  possible and, once these  opportunities
have been exhausted, through derivative financial instruments with third parties
using forward or option  agreements.  The Company currently also uses derivative
financial  instruments  to hedge the  Company&#39;s  exposure  to changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates for the translated  U.S. dollar value of the net income
of a number of foreign subsidiaries. Forward and option agreements used to hedge
net income are reflected at fair value. The Company&#39;s principal foreign currency
exposures  relate to the French franc,  the German  deutsche  mark,  the British
pound and the U.S. dollar.  At December 31, 1995 the Company held or had written
foreign currency forward agreements maturing through 1997. The Company uses some
of these agreements to reduce exposures to changes in foreign currency  exchange
rates  and to reduce  the risk that such  changes  would  adversely  affect  its
results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.  In  addition,  some of these
instruments  are  hedges  of  firmly   committed   transactions  and  forecasted
transactions that will or are expected to occur through 1996.














Financial  instruments  expose  the  Company  to  counterparty  credit  risk for
nonperformance  and to market risk for changes in interest and  currency  rates.
The Company  manages  exposure to  counterparty  credit  risk  through  specific
minimum credit standards,  diversification  of counterparties  and procedures to
monitor  the  amount of credit  exposure.  The  Company&#39;s  financial  instrument
counterparties  are substantial  investment or commercial banks with significant
experience with such instruments. The Company also has procedures to monitor the
impact of market risk on the fair value and costs of its  financial  instruments
considering  reasonably  possible  changes in interest and currency  rates.  The
Company  manages  market risk by  restricting  the use of  derivative  financial
instruments  to  hedging  activities  and by  limiting  potential  interest  and
currency  rate  exposures  to amounts  that are not  material  to the  Company&#39;s
consolidated  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Because  of the  above
practices and  procedures,  management  believes  that the Company&#39;s  credit and
market risk exposures from financial instruments are not significant at December
31, 1995.


                                                                              33

&lt;PAGE&gt;
&lt;PAGE&gt;

The values of the Company&#39;s  outstanding  derivative  financial  instruments  at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 are as follows:

The only  other  material  financial  instruments  that are not  carried  on the
Consolidated  Balance Sheet at amounts which approximate fair values are certain
debt  instruments.  The carrying   values of long-term debt and related  current
maturities (excluding capitalized leases of $43 and $47 million at year-end 1995
and 1994,  respectively)  are $1,512 and $1,507  million and the fair values are
$1,733 and $1,590 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The fair
values are estimated based on the quoted market price for the issues (if traded)
or based on current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same  remaining
maturity and characteristics.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The  Company  has a 1993 Stock Plan and a 1985  Stock  Plan  available  to grant
options and other related  benefits to employees.  Under both plans, the Company
may grant incentive and non-qualified  stock options,  stock appreciation rights
(SARs),  restricted  shares and  restricted  units (Units) to officers and other
employees.  SARs entitle an optionee to surrender  unexercised stock options for
cash or stock  equal to the excess of the fair market  value of the  surrendered
shares over the option  value of such shares.  The 1993 Stock Plan  provides for
the  annual  grant of  awards  in an  amount  not in excess of 1.5% of the total
shares  issued  (including  shares held in  treasury) on December 31 of the year
preceding  the year of the award.  Any shares that are available for awards that
are not utilized in a given year will be available for use in subsequent  years.
Units have been  granted  to  certain  employees,  which  entitle  the holder to
receive shares of common stock.  At December 31, 1995 there were 1,261,688 Units
outstanding,  including 304,500 Units granted in 1995, the restrictions on which
generally  lapse  over  periods  not  exceeding  ten  years  from date of grant.
Incentive stock options have a term determined by the Management Development and
Compensation Committee of the Board (Committee), but not in excess of ten years.
Non-qualified  stock options have been granted with terms of up to ten years and
one day. An option becomes exercisable at such times and in such installments as
set by the Committee.  Options  generally  become  exercisable over a three-year
period.

The Company also has a Stock Plan for Non-Employee  Directors  (Directors) under
which restricted shares and options are granted. New Directors receive grants of
1,500 shares of common stock, subject to certain restrictions. In addition, each
Director will be granted an option to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock each
year on the date of the annual meeting of shareowners. The Company has set aside
225,000 shares for issuance under the Directors plan.  Options  generally become
exercisable  over a three-year  period and have a term of ten years. All options
were granted at not less than fair market value at dates of grant.

Treasury  shares of common stock have been used upon exercise of stock  options.
Differences  between the cost of treasury  stock used and the total option price
of shares exercised have been reflected in retained earnings.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a number of lawsuits,  investigations and claims (some
of  which  involve  substantial  amounts)  arising  out  of the  conduct  of its
business,  including  those  relating  to  commercial  transactions,  government
contracts,  product liability and environmental,  safety and health matters. One
such lawsuit was brought by the B.F.  Goodrich  Company  (Goodrich)  in the U.S.
District Court for Delaware alleging  infringement by the Company of two patents
relating  to aircraft  brakes and seeking  injunctive  relief and  damages.  The
allegation  against the Company related only to brakes for the Boeing 777, which
was  introduced in 1995,  and not to any other brake program of the Company.  At
trial,  Goodrich claimed damages of approximately  $350 million before trebling.
On November 10, 1994, after a full trial on the merits, the District Court ruled
the Goodrich patents were invalid,  turned down Goodrich&#39;s claim for damages and
denied its  request for an  injunction.  On January 4, 1996,  the United  States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court&#39;s ruling.

In accordance with the Company&#39;s  accounting policy described in Note 1 of Notes
to Financial  Statements,  liabilities  are recorded for  environmental  matters
generally on the completion of feasibility  studies or the settlement of claims,
but in no  event  later  than  the  Company&#39;s  commitment  to a plan of  action.
Although  the Company  does not  currently  possess  sufficient  information  to
reasonably  estimate the amounts of the  liabilities  to be recorded upon future
completion of studies,  they may be significant to the  consolidated  results of
operations,  but  management  does not  expect  that they  will have a  material
adverse  effect on the  consolidated  financial  position of the  Company.  With
respect to all other  matters,  while the  ultimate  results of these  lawsuits,
investigations and claims cannot be determined,  management does not expect that
these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position of the Company.

The Company has issued or is a party to various direct and indirect  guarantees,
bank letters of credit and customer guarantees. Management does not expect these
guarantees will have a material  adverse effect on the  consolidated  results of
operations or the financial position of the Company.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND OTHER INFORMATION

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and on deposit as well as highly
liquid debt instruments with maturities  generally of three months or less. Cash

and $180 million and income taxes of $185, $164 and $130 million, respectively.

In  November  1994 the Company and  General  Motors  Corporation  formed a joint
venture to manufacture coated substrates for catalytic  converters.  The Company
contributed its environmental  catalysts business and General Motors contributed
other assets and a long-term sales contract to the venture.  The transaction had

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company&#39;s U.S.  retiree  medical  programs  cover  employees who retire with
pension  eligibility  for  hospital,  professional  and other  medical  services
(programs).  Most  of  the  programs  require  deductibles  and  copayments  and
virtually all are integrated with Medicare.  Retiree contributions are generally
required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. The Company also
sponsors retiree life insurance  programs which generally provide a flat benefit
of at least two  thousand  dollars or a benefit as a percent of pay. The retiree
medical and life insurance programs are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid
from the general assets of the Company.

For most  non-union  employees  retiring  after  July 1,  1992 the  Company  has
implemented  an  approach  which  bases the  Company&#39;s  contribution  to retiree
medical  premiums on years of service  and also  establishes  a maximum  Company
contribution in the future at approximately  twice the current level at the date
of implementation.

In 1995,  1994 and 1993 the Company&#39;s  cost for providing  other  postretirement
benefits aggregated $142, $150 and $153 million,  respectively. The Company uses
the services of an enrolled actuary to calculate postretirement benefit costs.

For measurement purposes, the assumed annual rates of increase in the per capita
cost of  covered  health care benefits  for 1995  were 7% to 10%  for  indemnity
programs and 6% for managed care programs which reduce to 6% for all programs in
the year 2000 and remain  at that level  thereafter.  The health care cost trend
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate,
increasing  the assumed  health care cost trend rates by 1  percentage  point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1995 by $170 million and the  aggregate of the service and interest
cost  component  of net periodic  postretirement  benefit cost for the year then
ended by $16 million. The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation was 7.25% and 8.75% at December
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

PENSIONS

The Company&#39;s  pension plans, most of which are defined benefit plans and almost
all of which are  noncontributory,  cover substantially all employees.  Benefits
under  the  plans  are  generally  based  on  years of  service  and  employees&#39;
compensation  during the last years of employment  or as a flat dollar  benefit.
Benefits are generally paid from funds previously  provided to trustees.  In the
Company&#39;s  principal U.S. plans, funds are contributed to a trustee as necessary
to provide for current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation
over a  reasonable  period.  To the  extent  that these  requirements  are fully
covered  by  assets  on hand  for a plan,  a  contribution  may not be made in a
particular  year.  As of year-end 1995  approximately  59% of the assets of U.S.
plans  were held in  equity  securities,  with the  balance  primarily  in fixed
income-type securities.

Pension  expense  in  1995,  1994  and 1993  was  $115,  $109 and $104  million,
respectively.  The Company uses the services of an enrolled actuary to calculate
the amount of pension  expense  and  contributions  to  trustees  of the various
pension plans.

The assumed rate of return for the Company&#39;s U.S.  defined benefit pension plans
was 9% in 1995, 1994 and 1993. The assumed discount rate used in calculating the
projected  benefit  obligations  at December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993 was 7.25%,
8.75% and 7.25%,  respectively.  In  addition,  the assumed  annual  increase in
compensation  over employees&#39;  estimated  remaining working lives was 5% in 1995
and 1994 and 5.5% in 1993.

Report of Independent Accountants


PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP  [LOGO]


February 1, 1996


To the Shareowners and Directors of AlliedSignal Inc.

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet and the related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  of  retained  earnings  and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AlliedSignal
Inc.  and its  subsidiaries  at December  31, 1995 and 1994,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December 31, 1995,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company&#39;s
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

As  discussed in Note 1 to the  financial  statements,  the Company  changed its
method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993.

                                    PART I.
 
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
 
     AlliedSignal Inc. with its consolidated subsidiaries (sometimes referred to
in  this Report as the Company) was organized  in the State of Delaware in 1985.
The Company is the successor to  Allied Corporation, which was organized in  the
State of New York in 1920.
 
     The  Company&#39;s  operations  are conducted  under  three  business segments:
aerospace, automotive and engineered materials.
 
     The Company&#39;s  products  are  used  by  many  major  industries,  including
textiles,   construction,  plastics,  electronics,  motor  vehicles,  chemicals,
housing,  telecommunications,  utilities,  packaging,  military  and  commercial
aviation and aerospace, and in the space program, and agriculture. The following
is  a description of  the Company&#39;s three business  segments and their principal
products and activities.
 
AEROSPACE
 
     The Aerospace  segment  is  among the  world&#39;s  largest  manufacturers  and
suppliers  of  advanced  technology  products  and  services  for  the military,
commercial and general aviation, and space markets.
 
     In  1994   the  Company   substantially  completed   a  restructuring   and
consolidation  of  Aerospace&#39;s 12  principal product  lines into  four strategic
business units:  Aerospace  Equipment Systems  (Equipment  Systems),  Commercial
Avionics   Systems  (Avionics  Systems),   AlliedSignal  Engines  (Engines)  and
Government Electronic Systems (Electronic Systems).
 
     The Company serves key  military and commercial  segments of the  aviation,
defense  and space markets with a broad array of systems, subsystems, components
and services. It designs, develops, manufactures, markets and services  hundreds
of  products  found  on  all types  of  aircraft,  from  single-engine executive
aircraft and wide-bodied &#39;jumbos&#39; flown  by the world&#39;s commercial carriers,  to
trainers,  transports, bombers,  fighters and helicopters  used by  the U.S. and
other countries for  national defense.  The Company&#39;s  global business  consists
primarily  of original-equipment  sales and  an extensive  aftermarket business,
including spare  parts,  maintenance  and repair,  and  retrofitting.  Worldwide
customers  include all of the major airframe and engine manufacturers, including
Boeing,  McDonnell  Douglas,  Lockheed,   Airbus  Industrie  (Airbus),   British
Aerospace,  Fokker, Cessna, Fairchild, Dassault, Rockwell International, Pratt &amp;
Whitney, General Electric (GE) and Rolls  Royce, as well as the world&#39;s  leading
airlines.
 
     Principal products, manufactured for military aircraft, civil air transport
and   general  aviation  markets,  include  primary  propulsion,  consisting  of
turboprop, turbofan, turbojet  and turboshaft engines,  and auxiliary power  gas
turbine  engines; environmental control systems, consisting of air conditioning,
cabin  pressure  and  temperature  controls;  airborne  weather  avoidance   and
collision  avoidance radar systems; forward-looking wind shear detection systems
and wing ice detection systems; aircraft communications -- both voice and  data;
microwave  landing systems; automatic flight  control systems; pneumatic control
systems; engine and  flight instruments;  motion sensing and  air data  systems;
navigation   and   identification   equipment,   including   identification   of
friend-or-foe  systems;  cockpit  data   recorders;  ground  proximity   warning
equipment;  electric power  generating systems;  fuel control  systems; aircraft
wheels and brakes;  test systems;  electromechanical and  hydraulic systems  and
components;  heat  transfer  equipment  and engine  oil  cooling  systems. Other
products include electronic cooling systems and infrared radiation suppressors.
 
     The Company  also manufactures  products for  missiles, spacecraft  defense
command,   control   communication   and  intelligence   programs   and  oceanic
applications, primarily  for  defense markets.  Products  include  cryptographic
equipment,  radar proximity fuzes, space-pointing  devices for deep space probes
and control  systems  for  spacecraft,  gyroscopes  for  tactical  missiles  and
military  aircraft, antisubmarine warfare  systems as well  as field engineering
management and technical support services to the National Aeronautics and  Space
Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
 
                                       4
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
     In  June 1994 the Company  sold a portion of  its small aerospace actuation
business and all of  its general aviation repair  and overhaul hangar  business,
consisting of five airport-based hangar facilities.
 
     In  October 1994 the Company completed the purchase of the Lycoming Turbine
Engine Division of Textron Inc. for  $375 million and the assumption of  certain
liabilities.  The  acquisition  extended the  Company&#39;s  turbine  engine product
offerings into the 50- to 115-seat  regional aircraft market and in  helicopters
and other commercial and military applications.
 
     The  Company entered into  a number of alliances  and joint ventures during
the year, of which the following  were among the most significant. The  Company,
to  be more  responsive to its  Japanese customers, formed  a strategic alliance
with  Shimadzu  Corporation,  Kyoto,  Japan  covering  aerospace  equipment  and
controls  products in Japan  under which the Company  designated Shimadzu as its
first-preference company for all  future manufacturing and business  development
in  Japan. The agreement  covers environmental control  systems, engine controls
and  accessories  and  actuation  products.  Engines  selected  Kawasaki   Heavy
Industries of Kobe, Japan as its partner to manufacture the Company&#39;s 131-series
auxiliary  power units (APU) for the new  McDonnell Douglas MD-90 and Boeing 737
aircraft programs.  Kawasaki  is  also developing  and  building  the  accessory
gearbox  for Engines&#39;  new RE220  APU. The  Company has  signed a  memorandum of
agreement to  form a  joint  venture with  TAECO,  a Hong  Kong-based  aerospace
company,  to start an aircraft maintenance center at TAECO&#39;s facility in Xiamen,
China. The joint venture  will provide repair and  overhaul services on all  the
Company&#39;s  products used by airline operators in China and the rest of Asia. The
Company also signed a letter of intent with China Eastern Airlines to  establish
a joint venture to provide aircraft wheel and brake repair and overhaul services
in Shanghai, China.
 
     The  Company is affected by the level of expenditures for defense and space
programs and  the  level  of  production  of  commercial  and  general  aviation
aircraft.  The  Company&#39;s  aerospace  products are  sold  directly  to  the U.S.
government, aircraft manufacturers and commercial  airlines, and to dealers  and
distributors of general aviation products.
 
     Moderate growth in the Company&#39;s commercial business for aerospace products
is  expected,  over the  long  term, to  mitigate  a reduction  in  U.S. defense
spending. Moreover, aerospace  sales are not  dependent on any  one key  defense
program   or  commercial   customer.  However,   contract  awards   by  aircraft
manufacturers, some of which are discussed below, can be cancelled or reduced if
aircraft orders are cut back. The products and services are sold in  competition
with  those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial
financial resources  and  significant technological  capabilities.  Among  those
companies  that  compete with  several of  the segment&#39;s  product areas  are GE,
Honeywell, Rockwell International, Sundstrand and United Technologies.
 
     Sales to the U.S.  government, acting through  its various departments  and
agencies  and through prime contractors, amounted to $1,886 million for 1994 and
$1,911 million  for 1993,  which  amounts include  sales  to the  Department  of
Defense  of $1,300 million in 1994 and $1,391 million in 1993. Approximately 59%
and 61% of sales  to the U.S.  government in 1994  and 1993, respectively,  were
made  under fixed-price  contracts in  which the  Company agrees  to perform the
contract for a fixed price and retains  for itself any benefits of cost  savings
or must bear the burden of cost overruns.
 
     Government  contracts are generally  terminable by the  government at will.
Upon termination,  the  contractor is  normally  entitled to  reimbursement  for
allowable  costs and  to an  allowance for profit.  However, if  the contract is
terminated because of the contractor&#39;s  default, the contractor may not  recover
all  of  its costs  and  may be  liable  for any  excess  costs incurred  by the
government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
 
     The Company, as are other government contractors, is subject to  government
investigations  of business practices and compliance with government procurement
regulations.  Although  such  regulations  provide  that  a  contractor  may  be
suspended or debarred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the  outcome  of  pending  government investigations  cannot  be  predicted with
certainty, management is not presently aware of any such investigation which  it
expects will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
     Orders  for  certain  products  sold  to  general  and  commercial aviation
customers  mainly  consist  of  relatively  short-term  and  frequently  renewed
commitments. Government procurement agencies
 
                                       5
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
generally  issue  contracts  covering  relatively long  periods  of  time. Total
backlog for products and services  for both government and commercial  contracts
was  $4,730 million at December 31, 1994 and $4,773 million at December 31, 1993
of which  U.S. and  foreign government  orders were  $1,803 million  and  $1,861
million  for the  respective years.  The Company  anticipates that approximately
$2,681 million of the total 1994 backlog will be filled during 1995.
 
     The Aerospace  segment&#39;s  international  operations  consist  primarily  of
exporting   U.S.  manufactured  products,  performance  of  services,  operating
aircraft repair and overhaul facilities and licensing activities. The  principal
manufacturing facility outside of the U.S. is in Canada.
 
     In 1994, as in the prior year, world defense spending continued to decline.
Furthermore,  most major U.S. and international airlines operated in a difficult
economic environment, with the modest turnarounds that began in the second  half
of  1993 continuing in  1994. While the regional  airlines showed some financial
strength, growth in the high end corporate aviation market remained slow.
 
     Aerospace was awarded  a number of  significant contracts in  1994 and  had
strong  success in booking new programs,  being awarded approximately 64% of the
programs bid.
 
     Aerospace was awarded several significant contracts related to Boeing&#39;s new
737-700 program totaling about  $3 billion in potential  sales over the life  of
the  program.  The  most  significant of  these  awards  included  the Company&#39;s
designation as the sole supplier  of APUs for this  new family of aircraft;  the
contract  has a sales  potential of $2 billion.  Equipment Systems won contracts
for the environmental control  and bleed air systems  with a sales potential  of
$370  million. GE&#39;s Aircraft Engines unit awarded contracts to Equipment Systems
for the main  fuel control  and the  air turbine  start system  for its  CFM56-7
engine  on the new 737 program with  a combined sales potential of $260 million.
Southwest Airlines awarded a contract with a sales potential of $225 million  to
Equipment  Systems  for  wheels and  brakes  on  its new  Boeing  737-700 fleet.
Equipment Systems was also awarded a contract for the engine nose cowl  anti-ice
valve with a sales potential of $22 million.
 
     The  Company  has  received  contracts for  the  proposed  MD-95, McDonnell
Douglas&#39; newest  twin-engine aircraft  for the  100-passenger market.  Equipment
Systems  will supply the environmental control systems and Avionics Systems will
provide the communications and navigational systems on a
Supplier-Furnished-Equipment basis.  The combined  sales  potential of  the  two
contracts is more than $500 million.
 
     Aero  Vodochody  of Czechoslovakia  selected International  Turbine Engines
Corp., a joint venture between Engines and the Aero Industry Development  Center
of  the Republic of China (Taiwan), to  supply F124-GA-100 engines for its L-159
light attack/advanced trainer aircraft. The  sales potential of the contract  is
$290  million. Aero Vodochody also chose  a Rockwell-AlliedSignal team to supply
the avionics suite for its L-159 program; Electronic Systems is responsible  for
supplying  and  integrating  selected  avionics  subsystems.  Lockheed  Aircraft
Services awarded  a contract  to Electronic  Systems to  upgrade the  integrated
cockpits displays and mission avionics in A-4M SkyHawk tactical fighters sold by
the U.S. government to the Republic of Argentina&#39;s Air Force.
 
     Engines  received an order  to supply the  Garrett Turbine Compressor Power
180C engine for up to 750 ground carts for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for the San
Antonio Air Logistics Center&#39;s Large Aircraft  Start System. The contract has  a
sales potential of $75 million.
 
     Electronic  Systems  received a  contract with  a  sales potential  of $200
million to  produce  an  inertial  measurement  unit  for  Northrop&#39;s  Brilliant
Anti-Tank Weapon.
 
     The  USAF&#39;s  Philips Laboratory  awarded  Equipment Systems  a  contract to
develop a turbopump. This contract has  sales potential of about $5 million  and
is  considered strategically significant because  it positions Equipment Systems
for entry into the turbopump market.
 
     Two important APU maintenance service agreements (MSA) were awarded  during
the  year. Southwest Airlines, for its fleet of 737 aircraft, awarded a contract
with a  sales potential  of $100  million  to the  Company and  Alaska  Airlines
selected the Company to service its APUs with a sales potential of $7.6 million.
 
                                       6
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
     The  Australian Civil Aviation Authority awarded  a contract for $9 million
to Electronic Systems to  provide a parallel approach  radar monitor (PARM)  for
Sydney&#39;s  airport;  it will  be the  third airport  in the  world and  the first
outside the U.S. with a PARM.
 
     The Company was  also awarded new  contracts in general  aviation in  1994.
Avionics Systems successfully penetrated the safety avionics market by winning a
contract  from Gulfstream to provide a  safety avionics suite for the Gulfstream
GV aircraft. The award included a  traffic alert and collision avoidance  system
(TCAS  II), ground  proximity warning  systems and  maintenance data acquisition
units. Israeli Aircraft Industries selected the Company for three contracts with
a combined  sales  potential exceeding  $30  million. The  TFE731-40  engine,  a
turbofan  from the Company&#39;s  new generation of TFE731  engines, was selected as
the propulsion system  for the  Astra SPX aircraft  and the  Company&#39;s APUs  and
environmental  control  systems  were  selected  for  the  Galaxy  business jet.
Dassault Aviation selected Engines to supply the most powerful of its new family
of turbofan engines,  the TFE731-60,  for Dassault&#39;s new  Falcon 900EX.  Engines

     Other key military aircraft equipment awards included wheels and brakes for
the  F-18E/F (the  Navy&#39;s first-line  fighter) and  the integrated environmental
control system for the F-22, by Equipment Systems, together with more than  $340
million in sales potential. The latter was particularly notable because it began
as  a procurement for  a single component of  the environmental control systems,
but
 
                                       7
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
Equipment System&#39;s strong focus on systems integration turned it into a contract
for the complete system.
 
     ATSC was successful in booking  several technical services programs.  These
programs  included the NASA White Sands program, with $225 million in sales, the
U.S. Marine Corps&#39; Maritime  Prepositioning Ship program,  with $125 million  in
sales,  and a number  of smaller NASA  programs with over  $130 million in sales
potential.
 
     In the commercial and general aviation aircraft market, in addition to  the
1994 awards previously mentioned, Equipment Systems was designated as one of two
wheel  and brake suppliers  for Boeing on  its new 737-700  transport, a program
with $1.3 billion in sales potential. On the new Gulfstream GV aircraft, Engines
was awarded  a contract  to supply  the APUs  and Equipment  Systems received  a
contract  for  the environmental  control  and cabin  pressure  control systems.
Together, the awards have a sales  potential of $130 million. Equipment  Systems
received  the engine  starting system  contract for  the BMW/Rolls  Royce BR-710
engine, the selected engine for both  the Gulfstream GV and the Canadair  Global
Express  aircraft.  Furthermore,  Equipment Systems  received  the environmental
control system contract for the new Learjet Model 45 general aviation  aircraft.
Equipment  Systems was  awarded contracts  for aircraft  wheels and  brakes from
Continental Airlines with a  sales potential of $170  million and from JAL,  Air

Electronic Systems the  ring laser  gyro and  momentum wheel  contracts for  its
IRIDIUM program and a ring laser gyro contract for its Frugal Satellite program.
The combined potential sales of these programs is $50 million.
 
     The  Company expects  that these programs  will require  only minimal fixed
capital spending.
 
AUTOMOTIVE
 
     The Automotive  segment designs,  engineers  and manufactures  systems  and
components  for worldwide  vehicle manufacturers and  aftermarket customers. The
segment&#39;s principal  business  areas  are braking  systems,  engine  components,
safety  restraint systems  and the  aftermarket. Within  each area,  the segment
offers a wide range of products for  passenger cars and light, medium and  heavy
trucks.
 
     For  manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks, the Company provides
disc and  drum brakes,  power  brake boosters  and master  cylinders,  anti-lock
braking  systems  (ABS),  friction  materials,  spark  plugs,  turbochargers and
occupant protection systems (seat belts, air bags and related components).
 
     The Company&#39;s primary product offerings for the manufacturers of medium and
heavy trucks and  off-road vehicles  primarily include air  and hydraulic  brake
actuation  components, air and hydraulic drum and disc brakes, ABS, compressors,
air dryers, friction materials, turbochargers and charge-air intercoolers.
 
     The aftermarket business includes replacement  parts for most of the  above
items  as well as air, oil and fuel  filters, wire and cable products, and brake
sealants and fluids.
 
     Automotive operations are located in  the U.S., Australia, Brazil,  Canada,
China,   France,  Germany,  India,  Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Malaysia,  Mexico,
Portugal, South  Korea,  Spain  and  the U.K.  Distribution  and  marketing  are
conducted  in  these  and  numerous other  countries  as  well. Internationally,
products are  marketed  under the  Bendix,  Fram, Autolite,  Garrett  and  Jurid
trademarks.
 
     Worldwide  passenger car  and truck original-equipment  sales accounted for
approximately 74% in 1994  and 70% in  1993 of the net  sales of the  Automotive
segment  with aftermarket  sales accounting  for the  balance. In  1994 and 1993
Automotive operations outside the U.S. accounted for $2,217 and $2,002  million,
or 45% and 44%, respectively, of worldwide sales.
 
     In  1994  and  1993  sales  of  automotive  original-equipment  systems and
components were made to approximately 30  customers of which the Company&#39;s  five
largest  automotive manufacturing customers accounted  for approximately 62% and
60%,   respectively,    of   such    sales.   Total    worldwide   sales    (for
 
                                       8
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
original-equipment and aftermarket use) for 1994 and 1993 to the five automotive
manufacturers  amounted to  $2,063 and $1,886  million, including  sales to Ford
Motor Company (Ford), the segment&#39;s largest  customer, of $782 and $715  million
for the respective years.
 
     In  1994 the  Company established  two joint  ventures in  Europe, one with
Sogefi S.p.A. and the other with Gilardini, a subsidiary of Fiat, and Sequa. The
joint venture with  Sogefi S.p.A.,  a European manufacturer  and distributor  of
automotive  filters and  other automotive products,  is expected  to enable both
partners to penetrate new  markets through a joint  distribution network and  to
reduce  costs through consolidation of both warehouses and distribution centers.
The joint venture with  Gilardini and Sequa --  BAG, S.p.A. -- will  manufacture
and  supply  hybrid  inflators for  driver  and  passenger-side air  bags  to be
assembled by a Company plant in Italy. These operations will provide the Company
with an entry into the European air bag market. In January 1995 the Company  and
Jidosha  Kiki Co. of Japan  formed a joint venture  to supply brake boosters for
vehicles built in Europe by Japanese manufacturers. The venture will be based in
Pamplona, Spain.
 
     The Company acquired substantially all of the seat belt business of General
Safety,  a North American designer and manufacturer of safety restraint systems,
in 1994. The acquisition is expected to bolster growth potential for the Company
as a leading supplier of vehicle safety restraint systems in North America.
 
     In late December 1994 the Company acquired Ford&#39;s spark plug  manufacturing
plant  in  Treforest,  South  Wales.  The  acquisition  enhanced  the  Company&#39;s
relationship with Ford as its sole supplier of spark plugs in both North America
and Europe and is expected to provide a manufacturing base in Europe for  growth
in the aftermarket spark plug business.
 
     In  February  1995 the  Company reached  an agreement  to acquire  the Budd
Company&#39;s Wheel and Brake Division, whose products include: rotors, hubs,  drums
and  related assemblies for  passenger cars and light  trucks; steel disk wheels
for heavy trucks; and demountable rims  and hub and drum assemblies for  medium-
and  heavy-duty trucks.  The Wheel  and Brake Division  had sales  of about $250
million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994. The Company signed a letter
of intent to acquire  Fiat Auto Poland S.A.&#39;s  braking business, whose  products
include  disc  and  drum  brakes,  master  cylinders  and  brake  boosters.  The
manufacturing facility of the business  is located in Twargodora, Poland.  Sales
of about $30 million are expected in 1995.
 
     Construction  of a new turbocharger plant in Shanghai, China began in 1994.
This facility is  expected to enable  the Company to  serve the rapidly  growing
diesel engine market in China and provide turbochargers to international markets
as  opportunities develop. In December 1994, as a temporary measure, the Company
began producing turbochargers in a leased facility in China.
 
     The  Company continues  to invest in  the ABS  and air bag  segments of the
automotive industry. New ABS product introductions and major awards on a  number
of car models continue to provide the Company with the synergies necessary to be
a  worldwide brake  system supplier.  The Company&#39;s  global air  bag position is
expected to continue to strengthen with the formation in 1994 of the BAG, S.p.A.
inflator joint venture and with the establishment of an air bag module  assembly
operation in Italy. The new air bag assembly operation has received sales awards
from European manufacturers.
 
     The Company initiated  facilities rationalization  plans in  1991 and  1992
which  will significantly  reduce the  number of  worldwide automotive locations
through 1995.  By  the  end  of  1994, 23  operating  plants  had  been  closed.
Rationalization  and consolidations of sales  offices, distribution centers, and
research and development facilities will continue throughout 1995.
 
     The segment&#39;s operations  outside the  U.S. are  conducted through  various
foreign  companies  in which  it has  interests ranging  from minor  to complete
control.  International   operations  also   include  the   exporting  of   U.S.
manufactured products and licensing activities.
 
     The Automotive segment&#39;s products are sold in highly competitive markets to
customers  who demand performance, quality and competitive prices. Virtually all
automotive components are sold in  competition with other independent  suppliers
or  with the captive component divisions of the vehicle manufacturers. While the
Company&#39;s competitive position varies among  its products, the Company  believes
it  is a  significant factor  in each  of its  major product  markets. The major
independent competitors in one or more major business areas include: ITT  Teves,
Lucas Girling, Rockwell-WABCO,
 
                                       9
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
Dana,  Autoliv, Cooper Industries, Schwitzer, Midland, Bosch, Kelsey Hayes, KKK,
TRW, Purolator, Delco, AM Brake, Raybestos, Takata and Morton.
 
ENGINEERED MATERIALS
 
     The Engineered  Materials  segment is  composed  of five  major  divisions:
Fibers, Fluorine Products, Performance Materials, Plastics and Laminate Systems.
Other  businesses not included  in these divisions are  the Paxon joint venture,
the Environmental Catalysts joint venture and Carbon Materials.
 
     Fibers. The Company is  a leading producer  of type 6  nylon and the  third
largest  producer of nylon in the U.S.  The Company is also the largest domestic
producer of caprolactam, the primary intermediate  for type 6 nylon, from  which
it  produces fine and heavy  denier nylon yarns and  molding compounds and film.
These yarns are sold under the  trademarks Anso&#39;r&#39;, Anso X&#39;r&#39;, Anso IV&#39;r&#39;,  Anso
V&#39;r&#39;, Worry-Free&#39;r&#39;, CrushResister&#39;tm&#39; and Caprolan&#39;r&#39;. In addition, the Company
produces heavy denier polyester yarns. The Company primarily sells yarns to  the
carpet, textile, motor vehicle and industrial markets.
 
     In the carpet yarn markets, both continuous filament and staple nylon yarns
are  sold to yarn processors  and mills for the  manufacture of carpeting. Nylon
filament and staple are the dominant fiber yarns used in carpet production.  The
four  largest  producers,  including  the Company,  have  over  90%  of domestic
capacity.  The  Company  has  achieved  recognition  as  a  leader  in   product
development and has developed a strong customer base. Brand identity, service to
customers  and quality are important competitive factors in the market and there
is considerable  price competition.  The Company  strengthened its  position  in
Europe  through the acquisition  of carpet yarn  facilities from Akzo  NV in the
third quarter of 1993.
 
     In the motor vehicle and industrial markets, the Company&#39;s primary products
are nylon  and  polyester  yarns  for  use in  tire  cord,  seat  belts,  hoses,
tarpaulins  and  outdoor furniture.  In Europe  the Company  produces industrial
polyester yarn in a  $200 million facility in  Longlaville, France, which  began
operations  in the fourth  quarter of 1993. The  Company believes that polyester
yarn will become the primary reinforcement for passenger car radial tires in the
world in the late  1990s and is exploring  development opportunities in the  Far
East.
 
     The  textile fibers markets, where the Company sells Caprolan&#39;r&#39; nylon flat
yarns for warp knit and  weaving applications, include intimate apparel,  sports
outerwear,  jackets and such recreational products  as sleeping bags, back packs
and luggage. The industry is highly price competitive.
 
     Fluorine Products. The major fluorine products are hydrofluoric acid  (HF),
fluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and sterilant gases.
 
     The Company is the world&#39;s largest producer of HF and an industry leader in
the  production and sale  of products derived  from HF, including fluorocarbons,
SF6 and uranium hexafluoride (UF6).
 
     Genetron&#39;r&#39;   fluorocarbons   are   sold   mainly   as   refrigerants    to
original-equipment   and  replacement  manufacturers  of  air  conditioning  and
refrigeration equipment  and as  foam blowing  agents to  rigid foam  producers.
Genesolv&#39;r&#39;   fluorocarbons  are   sold  as   solvents  in   precision  cleaning
applications  such   as   electronics,  optics   and   aerospace   applications.
Approximately  one-third of  the Company&#39;s Genetron&#39;r&#39;  and Genesolv&#39;r&#39; products
are chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs).  The  Montreal Protocol  (Protocol),  which  is
supported  by 87 countries, regulates  worldwide CFC production and consumption.
With few exceptions, the Protocol requires 100% elimination of fully halogenated
CFC production by  industrialized countries  by December 31,  1995. The  amended
U.S.  Clean Air Act  also regulates CFCs  and similarly requires  that most U.S.
production of CFCs be phased out by the  end of 1995. CFCs produced in the  U.S.
are   also  subject  to  the  Ozone   Depleting  Chemical  Tax  of  the  Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1989.
 
     The Company  is continuing  its  efforts to  develop  environmentally-safer
fluorocarbon  products as it replaces the  current CFC product line. An existing
commercial plant  in  El  Segundo,  CA was  converted  in  1991  to  manufacture
hydrochlorofluorocarbon  (HCFC)-141b,  a key  substitute  for CFC-11,  a blowing
agent in urethane foams,  and as a replacement  for CFC-113 in critical  solvent
applications.  By 1994 the Company more than  tripled the plant&#39;s capacity to 60
million pounds per year. The Company has
 
                                       10
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
commercialized key CFC  substitute products in  various applications,  including
automotive   air  conditioning   and  residential,   commercial  and  industrial
refrigeration.   In   this   connection,   the   Company   began   manufacturing
environmentally-safer  alternatives to CFCs  at a new  $70 million multi-product
commercial facility in Geismar, LA targeted primarily at the substitute products
HCFC-123, HCFC-124,  hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-125  and HFC-134a.  The Company  is
continuing  its  research  and  development  efforts  in  view  of  the changing
regulatory environment  in which  it operates.  The Company  does not  currently
expect  that the Protocol or the U.S. Clean Air Act will have a material adverse
effect on  the  Company. However,  the  Company  cannot predict  the  impact  of
possible future regulatory issues.
 
     The  Company acquired the CFC  business of Akzo NV,  with facilities in the
Netherlands, in  April 1994.  This  acquisition has  provided the  Company  with
access to new markets for its fluorocarbon products.
 
     The  Company is one of two domestic  producers of SF6, a gas primarily used
by  utilities  because  of  its  electrical  insulatory  properties  in  circuit
breakers, switches, transmission lines and electronic minisubstations.
 
     The Company also produces sterilant gases which primarily consist of blends
of  ethylene oxide and fluorocarbons that  are sold to hospitals, medical device
manufacturers and  contract  sterilizers.  The Company  holds  the  patents  for
selected sterilant gas blends using environmentally-safer fluorocarbons.

manufactures materials for semiconductor companies  worldwide. The Company is  a
leader  in  technology that  smoothes  integrated circuits  under  the trademark
ACCUGLASS&#39;r&#39;.
 
     The Company manufactures  amorphous metals (METGLAS&#39;r&#39;  Alloys) that  offer
significant  efficiency  gains  in  electrical  distribution  transformers  over
conventional electrical steel which is currently used. Amorphous metals are also
a key component in theft deterrent systems used by retail companies.
 
     Major  products  in  the  specialty  films  business  include  cast   nylon
(Capran&#39;r&#39;),  biaxially  oriented nylon  film  (Biax&#39;r&#39;) and  fluoropolymer film
(Aclar&#39;r&#39;). Specialty  film  markets  include food,  pharmaceutical,  and  other
packaging and industrial applications.
 
     The  Company&#39;s nuclear services business processes uranium ore concentrates
into UF6 which is an essential  intermediate in the production of fuel  elements
for  nuclear power reactors for domestic and foreign customers. In November 1992
a Company  subsidiary  entered  into  a  partnership  with  a  General  Atomics&#39;
affiliate   to  market  UF6  conversion   services  supplied  by  the  Company&#39;s
Metropolis,  Illinois  manufacturing   facility.  The  partnership,   ConverDyn,
competes  for the open world market with four foreign processors that are either
government owned or controlled.
 
     UOP is an equally owned joint venture with Union Carbide Corporation  which
designs  and  licenses processes,  and produces  and  markets catalysts  for the
petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical and food industries.
 
     Plastics.  The  Plastics  business  manufactures  and  markets  engineering
resins.  The  Company  is  a  leading producer  of  nylon  6  engineering resins
(Capron&#39;r&#39;) for  the  automotive,  electrical  and  electronic  component,  food
packaging,  lawn care and power tool markets. The Company completed an expansion
of the color compounding facility at Sparta, TN.
 
     Laminate Systems. This business  unit manufactures circuit board  laminates
for  the  electronic  and  electrical  industries.  The  Company&#39;s  product line
includes copper clad and unclad laminates used in
 
                                       11
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
computer,  telecommunication,   instrumentation   and   military   applications.
Approximately  50%  of  sales  are to  the  international  market,  primarily in
southeast Asia and throughout Europe. The industry is highly price  competitive.
The Company, in partnership with Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company, is backward
integrated  in electro deposited copper foil. The Company completed construction
of a new laminates plant in Thailand in the first quarter of 1994 and commercial
production commenced in the second quarter.

development of new products and processes, improvements in existing products and
processes, and the development of new uses of existing products.
 
     Research and development expense totaled $318 million in 1994, $313 million
in  1993  and $320  million in  1992.  Customer-sponsored (principally  the U.S.
government) research and development activities amounted to an additional  $486,
$514 and $501 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992.
 
     The  Company&#39;s Research and Technology organization has research facilities
at Morris Township, New Jersey and Des Plaines, Illinois consisting of  research
and  development  laboratories where  special  emphasis is  placed  upon applied
research and upon development of new products and processes. In addition,  there
are  approximately 48 other  research laboratories and  facilities which provide
direct support to the operating segments.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
     The Company is  subject to  various federal, state  and local  requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to  the protection of the environment. It is the Company&#39;s policy to comply with
these requirements  and the  Company believes  that, as  a general  matter,  its
policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable
risk   of  environmental  damage,  and  of  resulting  financial  liability,  in
connection with its  business. Some  risk of environmental  damage is,  however,
inherent  in particular operations  and products of  the Company, as  it is with
other companies  engaged in  similar  businesses. (See  the description  of  the
Engineered  Materials segment,  above, for  information regarding  regulation of
CFCs.)
 
     The Company is and  has been engaged in  the handling, manufacture, use  or
disposal of many substances which are classified as hazardous or toxic by one or
more  regulatory agencies. The  Company believes that, as  a general matter, its
handling, manufacture, use and  disposal of such substances  are in accord  with
environmental  laws  and  regulations.  It  is  possible,  however,  that future
knowledge  or  other  developments,  such  as  improved  capability  to   detect
substances  in  the  environment,  increasingly  strict  environmental  laws and
standards and enforcement  policies thereunder,  could bring  into question  the
Company&#39;s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of such substances.
 
     Among  other  environmental requirements,  the  Company is  subject  to the
federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which the Company has  been
designated  as a potentially  responsible party which may  be liable for cleanup
costs associated with various  hazardous waste sites, some  of which are on  the
U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Superfund priority list. Although, under
some
 
                                       13
 
&lt;PAGE&gt;
court interpretations of these laws, there  is a possibility that a  responsible
party  might have to bear more than  its proportional share of the cleanup costs
if it  is  unable to  obtain  appropriate contribution  from  other  responsible
parties,   the  Company  has  not  had  to  bear  significantly  more  than  its
proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.
 
     Capital expenditures  for  environmental  control  facilities  at  existing
operations  were $43 million in 1994. The  Company estimates that during each of
the years 1995  and 1996 such  capital expenditures will  be in the  $65 to  $70
million range. In addition to capital expenditures, the Company has incurred and
will continue to incur operating costs in connection with such facilities.
 
     Reference is made to Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis at page 21 of the
Company&#39;s  1994 Annual Report to  shareowners, incorporated herein by reference,
for further information regarding environmental matters.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The Company had  an aggregate of  87,500 salaried and  hourly employees  at
December  31, 1994. Of the approximately  30,000 unionized employees, 16,300 are
employed in  the  Company&#39;s  U.S.  and Canadian  plants  and  other  facilities.
Unionized  employees are represented by local unions that are either independent
or affiliated with  the United  Auto Workers, the  International Association  of
Machinists,  the United Steel  Workers of America, the  Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers International Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and many
other international unions. Relations between the Company and its employees  and
their  various representatives  have been  generally satisfactory,  although the
Company has experienced work stoppages from  time to time. Approximately 21%  of
the  Company&#39;s  U.S.  and  Canadian unionized  employees  are  covered  by labor
contracts scheduled to  expire in  1995. Major labor  negotiations will  include
locations in all of the segments.
 
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
 
     The  Company has 383 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories,
sales offices and other  facilities. The plants are  generally located to  serve
large  marketing areas and  to provide accessibility to  raw materials and labor
pools. The  properties are  generally maintained  in good  operating  condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with government spending and other business
conditions;  however,  no major  operating facility  is significantly  idle. The
facilities, together with planned expansions, are expected to meet the Company&#39;s
needs for  the  foreseeable  future.  The Company  owns  or  leases  warehouses,
railroad cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and
data  processing equipment.  It also leases  space for  administrative and sales
staffs. The Company&#39;s  headquarters and  administrative complex  are located  at
Morris Township, New Jersey.

MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
AlliedSignal Inc.

1994 COMPARED WITH 1993

IN 1994  THE  COMPANY  DEVELOPED  NEW  INITIATIVES  TO  IMPROVE  EFFICIENCY  AND
ELIMINATE WASTE,  SHARPEN ITS FOCUS ON CUSTOMER  SATISFACTION AND TARGET FOREIGN
GROWTH  OPPORTUNITIES.  PRODUCTIVITY  PROGRAMS  STARTED SINCE 1991  CONTINUED TO
ENHANCE AND GROW THE BUSINESS.  One new initiative -- Operational  Excellence --
will enhance productivity  programs by redesigning the Company&#39;s basic processes
to remove variations and improve manufacturing yields as well as by implementing
measurement tools to monitor our progress. Scrap and rework will be reduced from
the  design  phase  to  the  customer&#39;s  acceptance  of  our  products.  Another
initiative  -- Customer  Partnerships  -- involves  customers in  designing  the
Company&#39;s  products.  This program  strengthens  customer  relationships,  while
reducing cycle times in  engineering,  manufacturing  and product  support.  The
Company will start training  employees in 1995 in Total Quality Leadership Phase
II to provide  natural work teams with  analytical  tools for achieving  process
improvements. Previous actions -- forming commodity purchasing teams, partnering
with  suppliers,  sharing common  services  throughout  the Company,  cycle time
reductions and  rationalizing  the  organization  -- continued to move ahead and
generated significant savings.  Mainly as a result of these actions, the Company
had significantly higher operating margins in 1994.

DURING 1994 THE COMPANY LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IN 1995 AND BEYOND:

  *  Aerospace  acquired Textron&#39;s  Lycoming Turbine  Engine  Division (Lycoming
Engine) in October 1994 for $375 million in cash and the  assumption  of certain
liabilities.  Lycoming  Engine is expected  to have 1995 sales of  approximately
$450 million.  This acquisition extends the Engines group&#39;s product offerings in
the  robust  regional  aircraft  market  as well as into  helicopter  and  other
commercial and military  applications for turbine  engines.  To reduce costs and
improve  competitiveness  in its core product lines,  Aerospace  consolidated 12
businesses  into  four  integrated  units  and  merged  its  sales  and  service
organizations  into a single group.  During the year  Aerospace  introduced  new
high-technology  products  to enhance  flight  safety and also  agreed to form a
number of strategic  alliances in Japan and China to better position itself as a
global  supplier  and to  secure  a share  of the  fast-growing  markets  in the
Asian-Pacific  region.  The Company had a strong bidding success rate during the
year; it was awarded 64% of new programs bid.

  *  Globalization is also a key  factor in  Automotive&#39;s growth  strategy.  The
Company  acquired Ford Motor Company&#39;s  spark plug plant in the U.K.,  which had
1993 sales of about $20 million, and a seat belt manufacturer in Italy, owned by
the Fiat Group, which had annual sales of approximately $34 million.  Automotive
began construction of a $27 million  turbocharger  plant in Shanghai,  China and
has entered into joint venture agreements to produce air bag inflators in Italy,
to  distribute  aftermarket  products  throughout  Europe  and to  supply  brake
boosters from Spain for vehicles built in Europe by Japanese  manufacturers.  In
November  1994 the Company  acquired  the seat belt  business of General  Safety
Corporation,  a supplier to General Motors  Corporation and Ford. General Safety
had 1994 sales of about $95 million.

  *  Engineered Materials began manufacturing environmentally-safer alternatives
to  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs)  at a  new  $70  million  facility  in  Geismar,
Louisiana and acquired the small CFC business of Akzo N.V. in the Netherlands. A
joint  venture  agreement  with  General  Motors to  produce  coated  automotive
catalytic  converter  substrates  was  signed  in  November  1994.  The  venture
strengthens the technology and manufacturing capacity of both companies.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO INCREASE THE REGULAR  QUARTERLY  DIVIDEND ON THE
COMMON  STOCK BY 16%,  FROM $0.1675 TO $0.195 PER SHARE.  The dividend  increase
will be  effective  in the first  quarter of 1995.  The Company  had  previously
increased its regular quarterly dividend by 16% in the second quarter of 1994.

RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.  The  Company&#39;s  sales and  earnings  expanded to record
levels in 1994.  The Company  grew through new product  introductions  and niche
acquisitions  and by gaining  market  share in an expanding  worldwide  economy.
Internal   restructuring   and   productivity    improvements   drove   earnings
significantly higher.

NET SALES in 1994 were $12,817 million, an increase of 8% over last year. Of the
$990 million increase, $880 million was the result of strong volume gains by the
Automotive  and  Engineered   Materials  segments  and  $442  million  from  the
consolidation of recent acquisitions, offset in part by a $163 million reduction
for  disposed  businesses,  $131  million  due to lower  prices,  mainly  in the
Automotive  segment,  and  $38  million,  due to  unfavorable  foreign  exchange
fluctuations.

INCOME FROM  OPERATIONS of $1,152  million in 1994 improved by $198 million,  or
21%.  Excluding the nonrecurring items in 1993 (see Note 3 of Notes to Financial
Statements for information), income from operations improved by $214 million, or
23%.  Aerospace&#39;s income increased 12%; Automotive was 17% higher and Engineered
Materials had a 30% gain.  Profit margins increased from 7.9% in 1993 to 9.0% in
1994 and productivity (the constant dollar basis relationship of sales to costs)
increased by 6.2% over last year reflecting business consolidations,  cycle time
reductions,  materials management initiatives and unit sales increases.  See the
detailed discussion of net income below for information by industry segment.

                                                                              19

&lt;PAGE&gt;

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE),  a $27 million loss,  compares with a loss of $9 million
in 1993 reflecting higher minority interest as a result of the formation in late
1993 of a venture with a subsidiary of  Knorr-Bremse  AG  (Knorr-Bremse)  in the
U.S. and reduced  interest  income from  investments  in short-term  securities.
Reduced foreign exchange costs on forward contracts had a favorable impact.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL  CHARGES of $143 million  decreased by $14 million,
or 9%, from 1993 because of refunding a number of debt issues at lower  interest
rates and a reduced level of outstanding debt. Higher interest rates on floating
rate borrowings partially offset such savings.

THE  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE in 1994 was 31.7%  compared with 27.9% in 1993.  The 3.8
percentage  point increase in 1994 was due to a higher level of earnings subject
to the U.S. statutory rate, additional  non-deductible  expenses in 1994 and the
absence   of  the   favorable   impact   of  a  rate   increase   on  the   1993
beginning-of-the-year deferred tax balances as a result of the 1993 Tax Act. See
Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information.

INCOME BEFORE THE  CUMULATIVE  EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN AN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE of
$759 million,  or $2.68 a share,  in 1994 increased by $103 million,  or $0.37 a
share, compared with $656 million, or $2.31 a share, last year.

NET  INCOME  in 1994 was $759  million,  or $2.68 a share,  compared  with  $411
million,  or  $1.45 a  share,  for  1993.  However,  1993  was  impacted  by the
cumulative effect of adopting an accounting  change of $245 million,  or $0.86 a
share.  The  higher  income  in  1994  was  the  result  of a  strong  operating
performance by all segments.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS  SEGMENTS,  before the cumulative
impact of an  accounting  change on net  income,  follows.  Adjusted  net income
excludes the impact of the 1993 nonrecurring items. (Dollars in millions)

     Aerospace&#39;s  sales  increased 2% over last year.  The  acquisitions  of the
Lycoming Engine and Sundstrand Data Control operations and contract  settlements
with the U.S.  Air Force  contributed  significantly  to the higher  sales.  The
regional airline market continued to grow, but a reduction in military  spending
and weakness in the commercial  aircraft market continued to restrict sales. The
Engines group had lower sales of spares and repair and overhaul  services to the
aftermarket. Government Electronic Systems had lower sales of avionics equipment
to the military.  Equipment  Systems had reduced  commercial and military sales,
but sales from aircraft  landing  systems&#39;  repair and overhaul  operations were
higher, in part reflecting new business.  Commercial  Avionics Systems had lower
sales  mainly of  traffic  alert and  collision  avoidance  systems  (TCAS  II),
reflecting the completion of the airline industry retrofit  program.  Sales were
reduced  by  the  mid-year  1994   dispositions  of  the  actuation  and  hangar
businesses.

     Overall,  the Company&#39;s 1994 sales to the Department of Defense (DOD), as a
prime contractor and  subcontractor,  declined by 7% compared to 1993 because of
reduced defense spending. Sales to the commercial and foreign government markets
increased   by  5%,  while  sales  to  the   National   Aeronautics   and  Space
Administration  (NASA) and other U.S.  government  agencies  increased by 13% in
1994. Sales to the DOD accounted for 28% of Aerospace&#39;s  total sales, a decrease
of 3 percentage points compared with 1993.

     Although sales were up only slightly,  Aerospace&#39;s net income  increased by
14% compared  with last year&#39;s  adjusted net income.  Cost savings from business
consolidations, materials management and other productivity programs, especially
in the Engines group,  contributed to significantly  higher income.  The Engines
group also had lower  engineering  expense on certain  major  programs that were
winding down.  Government  Electronic Systems had favorable contract settlements
and Equipment  Systems had higher income from  commercial  aftermarket  sales of
aircraft landing systems. The benefits from the productivity programs offset the
continued  contraction  of military  spending  and  softness  in the  commercial
aircraft market.

     The U.S.  defense budget is expected to continue to decline for a number of
years.  A number of the Company&#39;s  military and space  programs may be stretched
out, curtailed or canceled.  However, the Company does not expect that its sales
will decline as rapidly as the defense budget because of its strong  competitive
position on various programs.  The Company&#39;s ability to successfully  retain and
compete  for such  business is highly  dependent  on its  technical  excellence,
management proficiency, strategic alliances and cost-effective performance.

     The Company believes that the cyclical downturn for the commercial aircraft
industry  will reach  bottom in 1995 and may show a small  improvement  in 1996.
Regional  airline traffic grew  significantly  and new regional  aircraft orders
were higher in 1994.  Aftermarket  shipments to the major airlines were slightly
lower than last year,  in part  because the  airlines  have  continued to reduce
excess inventories.

     The Company continues to receive significant  contracts from the commercial
aviation industry, DOD and NASA and earnings are expected to remain strong.

     At December 31, 1994 and 1993 the Company had firm orders for its aerospace
products  from the U.S. and foreign  governments  of $1,803 and $1,861  million,
respectively.  Total backlog,  including commercial contracts,  at year-end 1994
and 1993 was $4,730 and $4,773 million,  respectively.  The Company  anticipates
that  approximately  $2,681  million  of the total 1994  backlog  will be filled
during 1995.

     Automotive&#39;s  sales were up 9% compared with 1993. Demand was substantially
higher for braking systems, turbochargers and safety restraints. Strong original
equipment (OE) markets and new product  introductions  increased sales for North
American and European  brakes and air bags.  Sales of anti-lock  braking systems
(ABS)  increased  in 1994,  reflecting  new  business  with  Ford  and  Chrysler
Corporation due in part to the introduction of the Company&#39;s  advanced  traction
control system. Hybrid inflator technology spurred significantly higher sales of
air bag systems.  Strong diesel truck sales in North America and greater  demand
for  diesel-powered  cars in Europe  led to  significantly  higher  turbocharger
sales.  Turbocharger  plants  operated at capacity to satisfy the heavy  demand.
North American truck brake  systems,  which  benefited from strong OE medium and
heavy truck demand,  had increased sales.  Sales of European truck brake systems
are no longer consolidated, following the 1993 venture with Knorr-Bremse.

     Automotive&#39;s  adjusted net income increased by 21%, reflecting higher sales
for  turbochargers,  braking  systems,  truck brakes and air bags. OE sales were
very strong in the North American market, and European  businesses  strengthened
due to the  economic  turnaround  occurring  mainly in France and Spain.  Income
growth  was  limited  by  temporary  capacity  constraints  in the  turbocharger
business.  The Company will be expanding a number of turbocharger  facilities in
1995  to  meet   the   customer   demand.   Productivity   improvements,   plant
rationalization and materials management throughout the segment also contributed
to the significantly higher earnings.

     Sales in 1995 are expected to be moderately  higher due to a modest rise in
North American OE sales volume, a stronger European economy,  continued strength
for  turbochargers,  air bags  and ABS,  acquisitions  and a  somewhat  improved
worldwide aftermarket volume.

     Engineered  Materials&#39;  sales  increased 17% because of strong  automotive,
housing,  industrial and electronics markets. Higher sales volumes of industrial
and carpet  fibers also reflect  shipments  from the new  polyester  facility in
France and the acquisition of a carpet nylon business in Europe.  Laminates grew
significantly  through continued  globalization and market share gains. Fluorine
products  had  improved  sales  of  environmentally-safer   CFC  substitutes  as
additional  capacity  was  added  during  the  year and as a  result  of  recent
acquisitions.  Environmental  catalysts  had strong  sales to the OE  automotive

markets.  Amorphous  metals  expanded  sales  to the  article  surveillance  and
transformer markets.

     Adjusted  net income for  Engineered  Materials  was up by 22%,  reflecting
higher sales volumes for all businesses as well as operating  efficiencies.  The
laminate  systems  business had strong earnings on  substantially  higher sales.
Fluorine products had higher income reflecting increased CFC substitute capacity
and cost  reductions,  although pricing  pressures  limited gains. The amorphous
metals,  performance chemicals and uranium hexafluoride businesses had increased
income on higher sales.  Carpet and industrial fibers had  substantially  higher
earnings on  increased  sales  volumes  and prices,  but these gains were mostly
offset by higher raw  material  costs and by start-up  costs at the  Longlaville
facility.  Higher  profit  contributions  were  also  realized  from  Engineered
Materials&#39;  joint ventures -- Paxon  high-density  polyethylene  (Paxon) and UOP
process technology (UOP).

REGARDING  ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS,  the  Company is subject to various  federal,
state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment.  The
Company  believes  that,  as a  general  matter,  its  policies,  practices  and
procedures are properly  designed to prevent  unreasonable risk of environmental
damage and that its  handling,  manufacture,  use and  disposal of  hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations. However,
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor  companies,  the
Company is a party to lawsuits and claims and has incurred remedial response and
voluntary  cleanup  costs  associated  with  environmental  matters.  Additional
lawsuits,  claims  and  costs  involving  environmental  matters  are  likely to
continue  to arise in the  future.  The Company  continually  conducts  studies,
individually at Company-owned  sites, and jointly as a member of industry groups
at non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility of various remedial  techniques
to  address  environmental  matters.  It  is  the  Company&#39;s  policy  to  record
appropriate liabilities for such matters when environmental assessments are made
or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  The
timing of these accruals is generally on the  completion of feasibility  studies
or the settlement of claims, but in no event later than the Company&#39;s commitment
to a plan of action.

                                                                              21

&lt;PAGE&gt;

     Remedial  response  and  voluntary  cleanup  expenditures  were $66 and $65
million in 1994 and 1993, respectively,  and are currently estimated to increase
to approximately  $85 million in 1995. While annual  expenditures have generally
increased from year to year, and may continue to increase over time, the Company
expects  it will  be  able  to  fund  such  expenditures  from  cash  flow  from
operations. The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors, including
regulatory approval of cleanup projects,  remedial techniques to be utilized and
agreements with other parties.

     During 1994 the  Company  charged $37  million  against  pretax  income for
remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs. At December 31, 1994 the recorded
liability for environmental  matters was $494 million. In addition,  the Company
incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $80 million and
capital  expenditures of $43 million  relating to compliance with  environmental
regulations.

     Although the Company does not currently possess  sufficient  information to
reasonably  estimate  the  amounts of  liabilities  to be  recorded  upon future
completion of studies or  settlements,  and neither the timing nor the amount of
the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
may  be  significant  to  the  Company&#39;s  consolidated  results  of  operations.
Management  does not  expect  that  environmental  matters  will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.

     See  Note 20 of Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for a  discussion  of the
Company&#39;s   commitments   and   contingencies,   including   those   related  to
environmental matters.

REGARDING  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS,  the Company,  with  operating  and financing
activities  in 40  countries  and sales  throughout  the  world,  is  exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency  exchange rates. The Company
manages exposure to changes in interest rates through its regular  borrowing and
investing  decisions and, when deemed  appropriate,  through the use of interest
rate swap  agreements.  The  objective  of such risk  management  activity is to
minimize the cost of the Company&#39;s  debt  financing  over an extended  period of
time.  The Company  manages  exposure  to foreign  currency  exchange  rates for
transactional  items by  matching  and  offsetting  assets and  liabilities  and
thereafter  through  financial hedge  contracts with third parties.  The Company
does not use financial  instruments for trading or other  speculative  purposes.
See  Note 16 of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further  information  on
financial instruments.

INFLATION  has not been a  significant  factor  for the  Company  in a number of
years.  Cost  increases for labor and material have  generally been low, and any
impact has been offset by productivity enhancement programs, including materials
management.

FINANCIAL CONDITION. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $1 billion for
the third consecutive  year,  allowing the Company to continue to invest heavily
in  its  growth  initiatives  --  particularly  acquisitions  and  increases  in
capacity.   Additional  working  capital  investment  required  to  support  the
Company&#39;s sales growth during 1994 impacted further cash flow improvements. High
levels of operating cash flow, together with major debt repayments and increases
in retained earnings have resulted in a significant improvement in the Company&#39;s
financial position in recent years.

* Includes impact of cumulative effect of 1993 accounting change.

TOTAL  ASSETS at December  31, 1994 were  $11,321  million,  an increase of $492
million from December 31, 1993. Cash and cash  equivalents at year-end 1994 were
$508 million, a decrease of $384 million compared with December 31, 1993, mainly
reflecting the  acquisitions of Lycoming  Engine and General Safety.  Cash flows
from operating  activities  decreased by $137 million because of higher accounts
receivable  reflecting the Company&#39;s increased sales level. The current ratio at
year-end  1994 was 1.4x,  compared with 1.3x last year.  The  Company&#39;s  working
capital turnover improved to 5.5x at December 31, 1994 from 4.8x a year earlier.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING  available under the Company&#39;s  revolving credit
agreements (Credit  Agreements) was $900 million.  The Credit Agreements support
the issuance of commercial  paper as well as outstanding  floating rate Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) notes.  There was no commercial paper outstanding at
year-end 1994 and $164 million at the end of 1993.  Commercial  paper  borrowing
reached a high of $516 million during 1994. Outstanding ESOP notes, at favorable
floating  interest  rates,  totaled  $217  million at December 31, 1994 and $259
million at December 31, 1993.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end  1994 was $1,687  million,  a decrease  of $273  million,
primarily  as a result of paying down  commercial  paper and a  redemption  of a
deutsche  mark bond  issue.  Long-term  debt was  reduced by $178  million.  The
Company&#39;s  total debt as a percent of capital  was 34.1% at December  31,  1994,
down from 42.7% at year-end  1993. The long-term debt to capital ratio was 30.4%
at  year-end  1994,  down from 37.9% at year-end  1993.  See Note 14 of Notes to
Financial  Statements  for details of  long-term  debt and a  discussion  of the
Credit Agreements.

THE COMPANY  REPURCHASED  2.9 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $103 million in
1994.  Common stock was  repurchased in 1994 to meet expected  requirements  for
shares  issued  under   employee   benefit  plans  and  a  shareowner   dividend
reinvestment  plan. At year-end,  the Company had 75.1 million  shares of common
stock held in  treasury  carried at $1,505  million.  As of year-end  1994,  the
Company was authorized to repurchase 13.6 million shares of common stock.

&lt;PAGE&gt;

CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES  during 1994 were $639 million,  a decrease of $79 million
from the $718 million  spent in 1993.  Spending by the  segments  and  Corporate
since 1992 is shown in Note 26 of Notes to Financial  Statements.  The Company&#39;s
total  capital  expenditures  in 1995 are  currently  projected  at  about  $700
million.  These expenditures are expected to be financed by internally generated
funds.  Approximately  65% of the projected  1995  expenditures  are planned for
expansion and cost  reduction,  25% for  replacement and maintenance and 10% for
environmental projects.

1993 COMPARED WITH 1992

IN 1993 THE COMPANY INITIATED A NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS AND FURTHERED THOSE BEGUN
IN 1991 AND 1992. A number of growth  businesses were enhanced  through internal
product development,  strategic  acquisitions,  joint ventures and major capital
investments.  The Company is overhauling  its basic processes to increase market
penetration  and  forming  commodity  purchasing  teams  and  working  with  its
customers and suppliers to raise product quality and reduce production costs.

THE COMPANY STRENGTHENED A NUMBER OF MAJOR BUSINESSES IN 1993:

  *  To  become a more  broad-based  avionics  supplier,  the  Company  acquired
Sundstrand Data Control for $195 million.  The acquired business  manufactures a
variety of avionics  products  for data  management,  ground  hazard  avoidance,
general aviation  communications,  navigation and  instrumentation.  The Company
also acquired the aircraft wheel and brake repair and overhaul operations of Air
Treads, Inc.

  *  To  strengthen  the  Company&#39;s  position in air brake  controls and related
products  for the truck  industry,  the  Company  and  Knorr-Bremse  formed  two
ventures -- one in North America and one in Europe.  The Company owns 65% of the
North American  operation and 35% of the European  operations.  The Company also
acquired  Filtram  S.A.,  a  manufacturer  and  distributor  of its Fram  filter
products in Mexico.

  *  In the fibers business,  the Company, as the majority shareowner,  and Akzo
NV of Arnhem,  the  Netherlands  formed a new company to manufacture  and market
commercial carpet fibers in Europe. The Company also started up its $200 million
industrial polyester fiber plant in Longlaville, France.

  *  The Company expanded its  fluorocarbon  business through the acquisition of
the U.S. sterilant gas business of Praxair Inc. and by more than doubling,  from
20 to 50 million pounds per year, the Company&#39;s  hydrofluorocarbons  (HCFC)-141b
capacity  at its El Segundo,  California  facility.  HCFC-141b  is a new blowing
agent used in a variety of  commercial  and  residential  rigid-insulating  foam
applications.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED,  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1993, AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE RELATED TO
POSTEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement No. 112 -- Employers&#39; Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (FASB No.
112) which  requires the accrual of cost over an employee&#39;s  service  life.  The
1993 impact of FASB No. 112 was an after-tax  provision of $11 million, or $0.04
a share. As part of the adoption,  the Company also recorded catch-up  after-tax
charges  totaling $245 million,  or $0.86 a share.  This one-time charge reduced
the Company&#39;s shareowners&#39; equity by 11%.

RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.  The  Company&#39;s  earnings  grew to record levels in 1993
benefiting from  productivity  actions and only a slowly recovering U.S. economy
which more than  offset  the  impact of a  depressed  aerospace  industry  and a
recession in Europe.

NET SALES in 1993 were  $11,827  million,  down 2% from last  year.  Of the $215
million  decrease,  $206  million  was the  effect  of the  stronger  dollar  on
Automotive  and $81 million was because of reduced sales volumes  reflecting the
recession in Europe and weakness in the  aerospace  industry,  offset in part by
$72 million of price increases.

COST OF GOODS SOLD, as a percent of sales, decreased from 82.4% in 1992 to 80.8%
in 1993.  The  improvement  was the  result  of  productivity  gains,  including
cycle-time  reductions  and  materials  management  initiatives  throughout  the
Company. Productivity grew by 5.8% over last year.

NONRECURRING  ITEMS  consist of a net gain of $16 million from the  formation of
the Knorr-Bremse venture offset mainly by the cost of several unusual items. See
Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.

INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS  of $954  million  in 1993  improved  by $539  million.
Excluding  the  nonrecurring  items in 1993 and the  current  year&#39;s  impact  of
adopting FASB No. 112 as well as charges for streamlining  and  restructuring in
1992 (special  provisions),  income from operations improved by $173 million, or
22%,  reflecting  significant  earnings  gains  despite a  generally  slow world
economy. After excluding the special provisions, Aerospace&#39;s income increased 4%
and  Automotive&#39;s  and Engineered  Materials&#39;  income both increased 32%. Profit
margins,  adjusted to exclude  nonrecurring  items in 1993 and  streamlining and
restructuring  charges in 1992,  increased from 6.5% in 1992 to 7.9% mainly as a
result of improved  productivity  throughout the Company.  See the discussion of
net income below for information by segment.

EQUITY  IN INCOME OF  AFFILIATED  COMPANIES  of $122  million  increased  by $19
million, or 18%, reflecting higher earnings for UOP. Paxon,  however,  had lower
income as industry overcapacity depressed prices.

EARNINGS FROM UNION TEXAS  INVESTMENT  reflects the disposition of the Company&#39;s
common  stock  holdings in 1992 as  discussed  in Note 22 of Notes to  Financial
Statements.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), a $9 million loss, compares with a gain of $9 million in
1992 reflecting  increased  foreign  exchange losses in Europe and Brazil partly
offset by higher interest income from investments in short-term securities.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES of $157 million  decreased $63 million,  or
29%, from last year because of a lower  average level of total debt  outstanding
reflecting in part the redemption of three debt issues and lower interest rates.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE in 1993 was 27.9% compared with 23.8% in 1992.  Excluding
the  impact  in 1992 of  streamlining  and  restructuring  charges  and the gain
relating to Union Texas Petroleum  Holdings,  Inc. (Union Texas),  the effective
tax rate for 1992 was 24.1%.  The 3.8  percentage  point  increase  was due to a
higher  level of earnings  taxed at the new higher U.S. tax rate and the absence
of preferentially taxed Union Texas dividends. A partial offset resulted from an
adjustment  to deferred  tax balances  because of the 1993 tax rate change.  Net
income for 1993 benefited by about $0.02 a share from the net effect of the 1993
tax law  changes.  See Note 7 of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.

                                                                              23

&lt;PAGE&gt;

INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES of $656
million,  or $2.31 a share,  in 1993 increased  $121 million,  or $0.41 a share,
compared with $535 million, or $1.90 a share, last year.

NET INCOME (LOSS) in 1993 was income of $411 million,  or $1.45 a share. In 1992
the Company  reported a loss of $712 million,  or $2.52 a share.  However,  both
periods were affected by the cumulative  effects of adopting  accounting changes
as well as unusual  items.  The 1993 results  included the current year&#39;s charge
for adopting  FASB No. 112, a net  nonrecurring  gain and the impact of the U.S.
tax increase. Results in 1992 include streamlining and restructuring charges and
the gain on the  disposition  of Union  Texas.  Excluding  these items from both
years, the current year&#39;s net income was $659 million,  or $2.33 a share,  which
compares with net income of $541 million,  or $1.92 a share, in 1992. The higher
income was the result of  significant  increases for  Automotive  and Engineered
Materials.

A DISCUSSION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS  SEGMENTS,  before the cumulative
impact of  accounting  changes  on net  income,  follows.  Adjusted  net  income
excludes the impact of the 1993 nonrecurring items and the 1992 streamlining and
restructuring provision. (Dollars in millions)

     Aerospace  sales  decreased  8% because  of  continued  significant  volume
reductions  in  military,   commercial  and  general  aviation  markets.   Lower
production of general  aviation  aircraft  resulted in fewer  propulsion  engine
deliveries.  Aftermarket sales were  significantly  lower in the auxiliary power
unit (APU) product line. Mainly because of a reduction in the number of aircraft
built,  sales of controls and  accessories and fluid systems as well as avionics
and  communications  systems were materially lower.  Technical service contracts
awarded by various  government  agencies  and sales of ocean  systems  increased
moderately. Sales of aircraft landing systems increased slightly and aftermarket
sales related to propulsion  engines were higher.  The acquisition of Sundstrand
Data Control in the fourth quarter of 1993 contributed $24 million to sales.

     Overall,  the Company&#39;s  1993 sales to the DOD, as a prime  contractor  and
subcontractor,  declined by 11% compared  with 1992  because of reduced  defense
spending. Sales to the commercial and foreign government markets declined by 9%,
while sales to NASA and other U.S.  government agencies increased by 6% in 1993.
Sales to the DOD accounted for 31% of  Aerospace&#39;s  total sales, a decrease of 1
percentage point compared with 1992.

     Although  total sales were lower and 1993  results  included  an  after-tax
charge of $5 million reflecting the impact of adopting FASB No. 112, Aerospace&#39;s
adjusted  net  income  improved  slightly  compared  to  last  year.  Continuing
productivity  improvements and sales increases in several product lines were the
principal  offsets.  Significant  cost savings were realized at every  operating
business  unit.   Aerospace  Systems  and  Equipment  had  substantially  higher
earnings.   Higher  aftermarket  sales  related  to  aircraft  landing  systems,
propulsion  engines and guidance and control  systems as well as higher sales of
ocean systems and technical services also contributed to the favorable earnings.
Earnings were lower for avionics,  APUs and  communications  systems  because of
lower sales.

     At December 31, 1993 and 1992 the Company had firm orders for its aerospace
products  from the U.S. and foreign  governments  of $1,861 and $1,712  million,
respectively.  Total backlog,  including commercial contracts,  at year-end 1993
and 1992 was $4,773 and $4,859 million, respectively.

     Automotive sales were essentially level with last year despite the negative
impact,   totaling  $206  million,   of  translating  mainly  weakened  European
currencies  to the U.S.  dollar.  Sales of all  products  in the North  American
market were higher.  OE sales for passenger cars,  light trucks and heavy trucks
rebounded.  Sales of passenger-side air bags were especially strong and sales of
seat belts,  aftermarket products,  turbocharging systems and ABS also improved.
Sales by the Company&#39;s Brazilian operations improved. OE and aftermarket product
sales were materially lower in Europe reflecting the impact of the recession.

     Automotive&#39;s adjusted net income increased significantly, reflecting higher
sales to the North  American OE  manufacturers  and the  aftermarket  and strong
productivity   gains.   Rationalization  and  enhanced   productivity   programs
continued,  mainly in Europe,  where sales are down  materially  due to the poor
economy.  In the North  American  market,  automotive  and truck brakes,  safety
restraints,  aftermarket  products and  turbochargers  had substantial  earnings
growth. Productivity improvements and higher sales volumes substantially reduced
prior year losses in Brazil.  The 1993 results include an after-tax charge of $3
million reflecting the impact of adopting FASB No. 112.

     Engineered  Materials had a 7% sales increase.  Sales of fluorine products,
including  environmentally-safer  substitutes for CFCs, grew substantially,  and
sales of laminate systems,  oximes,  performance additives and tar products were
materially  higher.  Sales of carpet and industrial  fibers also  improved,  but
sales of intermediate  chemicals and environmental  catalysts were lower because
of weak market conditions.

     Engineered  Materials&#39; adjusted net income was significantly higher in 1993
because  of  strong  productivity  gains  and  improved  revenues  for  fluorine
products,  industrial fibers,  performance  additives and tar products.  Results
also improved for UOP.  Partially  offsetting  these gains were higher operating
costs for laminate systems,  reduced demand for intermediate chemicals and lower
earnings for Paxon.  The 1993 results include an after-tax  charge of $2 million
reflecting the impact of adopting FASB No. 112.

&lt;PAGE&gt;

REGARDING  ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS,   remedial  response  and  voluntary  cleanup
expenditures were $65 and $69 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     During 1993 the Company  charged $41 million  against  income for  remedial
response  and  voluntary  cleanup  costs.  At  December  31,  1993 the  recorded
liability for environmental  matters was $480 million. In addition,  the Company
incurred ongoing operating costs, and made capital  expenditures of $39 million,
relating to compliance with environmental regulations.

FINANCIAL  CONDITION.  Cash flow from operating activities was materially higher
as a result of strong earnings  growth and a  strengthening  balance sheet which
reflects greatly improved  operating working capital and a significant  customer
advance.

TOTAL  ASSETS at December  31,  1993 were  $10,829  million,  an increase of $73
million from December 31, 1992. Cash and cash  equivalents at year-end 1993 were
$892 million, a decrease of $39 million, however, cash investments classified as
long-term  increased  $40 million,  to $90 million,  at December 31, 1993.  Cash
flows from operating activities, provided by significantly improved earnings for
1993 and a reduction in working capital,  increased by $111 million. The current
ratio at year-end  1993 was 1.3x,  down slightly from 1.4x at December 31, 1992.
Mainly through a reduction in accounts receivable and inventories, the Company&#39;s
working  capital  turnover was improved to 4.8x at December 31, 1993 from 4.5x a
year earlier.

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF BORROWING  available under the Company&#39;s Credit Agreements
was  reduced  by the  Company in July 1993 from  $1.11  billion to $900  million
reflecting the Company&#39;s strong cash position, significantly higher earnings and
current  credit  requirements.  The Credit  Agreements  support the  issuance of
commercial  paper  and  outstanding  floating  rate ESOP  notes.  There was $164
million of commercial  paper  outstanding at year-end 1993 and $4 million at the
end of 1992.  Commercial  paper borrowing  reached a high of $484 million during
1993. Outstanding ESOP notes, at favorable floating interest rates, totaled $259
million at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

TOTAL DEBT at year-end  1993 was $1,960  million,  a decrease  of $153  million.
Long-term debt was reduced by $175 million mainly from the redemption of various
debt  issues.  The  Company&#39;s  total  debt as a percent  of  capital,  after the
adoption of FASB No. 112,  was 42.7% at December  31,  1993,  down from 44.7% at
year-end  1992.  The long-term debt to capital ratio was 37.9% at year-end 1993,
down from 40.5% at year-end 1992. In January 1993 Moody&#39;s upgraded the Company&#39;s
long-term  debt from A3 to A2 and its  commercial  paper  from P-2 to P-1.  This
followed a comparable upgrading from Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s in December 1992.

THE COMPANY  REPURCHASED  6.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK for $220 million in
1993.  Common stock was repurchased in 1993 to offset the issuance of shares for
employee benefit plans and a shareowner dividend reinvestment plan.

CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES  during 1993 were $718 million, an increase of $27 million
from the $691 million  spent in 1992.  Spending by the segments and Corporate is
shown in Note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AlliedSignal Inc.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
 
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
 
CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS include the accounts of AlliedSignal Inc. and
majority-owned subsidiaries.
 
INVENTORIES are  valued  at the  lower  of cost  or  market using  the  last-in,
first-out  (LIFO)  method for  certain qualifying  domestic inventories  and the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method for other inventories.
 
INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM  RECEIVABLES are  carried at market  value if  readily
determinable  or  cost  in  1994;  prior  to  1994,  investments  and  long-term
receivables were  carried  at  the  lower of  cost  or  market.  Investments  in
affiliates over which significant influence is exercised are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting.
 
PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT are carried at cost and are generally depreciated
using estimated service lives, which range from 3 to 40 years. For the financial
statements, depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method.
 
COST IN EXCESS  OF NET  ASSETS OF  ACQUIRED COMPANIES  is being  amortized on  a
straight-line  basis  over various  periods  ranging from  20  to 40  years. The
cumulative amount of goodwill  amortized at December 31,  1994 and December  31,
1993 is $358 and $315 million, respectively.
 
POSTEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS for former or  inactive employees, excluding retirement
benefits, are  accounted  for  under  the  provisions  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards   Board  (FASB)  Statement  No.  112  --  &#39;Employers&#39;  Accounting  for
Postemployment Benefits&#39; (FASB No. 112), effective January 1, 1993. FASB No. 112
requires  the  Company  to  accrue  the  cost  of  certain  benefits,  including
severance,  workers&#39; compensation and  health care coverage,  over an employee&#39;s
service life. A one-time charge for the adoption of FASB No. 112 of $396 million
(after-tax $245 million,  or $0.86  a share)  was recognized  as the  cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in 1993. The 1993 ongoing expense was
$18  million (after-tax  $11 million,  or $0.04 a  share). The  Company uses the
services of an enrolled actuary  to calculate postemployment costs. The  Company
previously  expensed  the cost  of  such benefits  on  a pay-as-you-go  basis or
recognized the impact at the time of a specific event.
 
RECOGNITION OF  CONTRACT REVENUES  primarily  relates to  Aerospace  operations.
Under  fixed-price contracts, sales and related costs are recorded as deliveries
are made. Sales and related costs under cost-reimbursable contracts are recorded
as costs are  incurred. Anticipated future  losses on contracts  are charged  to
income  when identified. Contracts which are part  of a program are evaluated on
an overall program basis.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL expenditures that  relate to  current operations  are expensed  or
capitalized  as appropriate. Expenditures  that relate to  an existing condition
caused by past  operations, and  which do not  contribute to  current or  future
revenue  generation, are  expensed. Liabilities are  recorded when environmental
assessments are  made or  remedial efforts  are probable  and the  costs can  be
reasonably  estimated.  The  timing  of  these  accruals  is  generally  on  the
completion of feasibility studies or the  settlement of claims, but in no  event
later  than the Company&#39;s  commitment to a  plan of action.  The liabilities for
environmental costs recorded  in Accrued  Liabilities and  Other Liabilities  at
December  31, 1994 and 1993 were $78 and  $416 million and $66 and $414 million,
respectively.
 
INTEREST RATE  AND FOREIGN  CURRENCY  FORWARD, OPTION  AND SWAP  AGREEMENTS  are
accounted  for as a  hedge of the  related asset, liability,  firm commitment or
anticipated transaction when designated as a hedge of such items. Agreements not
qualifying for hedge accounting are reflected at fair value.
* Changes in  the  amount  to  be  received or  paid  under  interest  rate swap
  agreements are recognized in Interest and Other Financial Charges.
* Changes  in the  fair value  of foreign  currency agreements are recognized in
  Other Income (Expense) or  Cumulative Foreign Exchange Translation Adjustment,
  as appropriate.
 
INCOME  TAXES are  based on  the asset and  liability approach  embodied in FASB
Statement No. 109  -- &#39;Accounting for  Income Taxes&#39; (FASB  No. 109),  effective
January  1, 1992. Under FASB No. 109, deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect
the impact of temporary  differences between amounts  of assets and  liabilities
for  financial and  tax reporting.  Such amounts  are subsequently  adjusted, as
appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates  expected to be in effect when  the
temporary  differences  reverse. A  valuation allowance  is established  for any
deferred tax asset for  which realization is not  likely. Deferred income  taxes
have  not been provided on approximately  $177 million of undistributed earnings
of  foreign  affiliated  companies  which  are  considered  to  be   permanently
reinvested.  Any U.S. taxes  payable on foreign earnings  which may be remitted,
however, will be substantially offset by foreign tax credits.
 
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
 
In 1994 the  Company acquired the  Lycoming Turbine Engine  Division of  Textron
Inc.  (Lycoming Engine) for $375  million in cash and  the assumption of certain
liabilities. The  business  had 1994  sales  of $550  million.  Lycoming  Engine
manufactures  turbofan  engines for  regional  airlines, helicopter  engines for
commercial, military  and utility  aircraft, military  tank engines  and  marine
propulsion  engines. The Company  also made a number  of smaller acquisitions in
1994.
   In 1993  the  Company  acquired  the  data  control  business  of  Sundstrand
Corporation  (Data Controls) for $195 million in cash. The business had sales of
$194 million in 1992. Data Controls  manufactures a wide range of avionics  such
as  ground  proximity  warning systems,  reactive  windshear  detection systems,
flight data and voice  recorders, general aviation  in-flight phone systems  and
aircraft condition monitoring systems. The Company also made a number of smaller
acquisitions in 1993.
 
NOTE 3. NONRECURRING ITEMS
 
The  1993 nonrecurring  items consist  of a gain  of $89  million (after-tax $50
million, or $0.17 a share)  from the formation of  an alliance of the  Company&#39;s
air-brake control and related
 
                                                                              29
 &lt;PAGE&gt;

product operations for heavy trucks with those of Knorr-Bremse AG, partly offset
by  a provision totaling $73  million (after-tax $49 million,  or $0.17 a share)
covering transaction  and other  costs, including  formation costs  relating  to
Knorr-Bremse  and other business ventures  as well as the  cost of several legal
actions.
 
NOTE 4. STREAMLINING AND RESTRUCTURING
 
The 1992 provision  reflects a  pretax charge  of $368  million (after-tax  $227
million,  or $0.80 a  share) covering programs to  improve the Company&#39;s overall
productivity. These  programs  include  the consolidation  of  facilities  ($187
million),  further streamlining of operations  and administration ($103 million)
and the  cost of  product modifications  to improve  customer satisfaction  ($78
million).  The various programs include the  elimination of about 900 hourly and
salaried employees. The  actions contemplated  in the 1992  provision have  been
essentially completed.

Other tax credits relate  primarily to U.S. general  business tax credits  which
are  available  to  reduce  income  tax  payments  through  the  year  2008. The
alternative minimum  tax  credit  is  available to  reduce  regular  income  tax
payments  for an  indefinite period  of time.  The foreign  net operating losses
relate to several  countries. Such  losses are  available to  reduce income  tax
payments  in the future,  subject to varying expiration  rules. The U.S. capital
loss is available to offset income tax payments on capital gains through 1997.

The Company is a party to agreements under which it can sell undivided interests
in designated pools  of trade accounts  receivable up to  $500 million  (average
outstanding  was $500 and $492 million  during 1994 and 1993, respectively). New
receivables are sold  under the  agreements as previously  sold receivables  are
collected. During 1994, this represented an average collection period of 47 days
or  a replacement of receivables of  approximately eight times. At both December
31, 1994  and 1993,  customer accounts  receivable on  the Consolidated  Balance
Sheet have been reduced by $500 million, reflecting such sales. The Company acts
as  an agent  for the  purchasers in  the collection  and administration  of the
receivables.

(1) Amounts are net of repurchases.

   The  Company has two credit  agreements with a group of  21 banks (3 Year and
364 Day Credit Agreements) with commitments aggregating $900 million. The  funds
available  under the  Credit Agreements may  be used for  any corporate purpose.
Loans under the $450 million 3 Year  Credit Agreement are required to be  repaid
no  later than July 7, 1997. Annually, the Company may request that the maturity
of the 3 Year Credit Agreement be extended by another year. The Company  intends
to request an extension of the agreement in 1995. The banks&#39; commitments to lend
under  the $450 million 364  Day Credit Agreement terminate  on July 3, 1995 and
any loans then outstanding will be converted  to term loans maturing on July  3,
1996. The Company intends to renegotiate this agreement in 1995. The Company has
agreed  to pay  facility fees  of 0.10%  per annum  and 0.08%  per annum  on the
aggregate commitments for 3  Year and 364  Day Credit Agreements,  respectively,
subject  to  increase or  decrease  in the  event  of changes  in  the Company&#39;s
long-term debt  ratings. The  Credit Agreements  do not  restrict the  Company&#39;s
ability  to pay  dividends or  require the  Company to  maintain a  specific net
worth. However,  they  do  contain  other customary  conditions  and  events  of
default,  the failure to comply with, or  occurrence of, which would prevent any
further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any  outstanding
borrowings under either Credit Agreement. Such conditions include the absence of
any  material  adverse  change  in  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  pay  its
indebtedness when due,  and such events  of default include  (a) non-payment  of
Credit Agreement debt and interest thereon, (b) non-compliance with the terms of
the  covenants, (c) cross-default with other  debt in certain circumstances, (d)
bankruptcy and  (e)  defaults upon  obligations  under the  Employee  Retirement
Income  Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate
its commitment  to lend  under the  Credit  Agreements if  any person  or  group
acquires  beneficial ownership of 30%  or more of the  Company&#39;s voting stock or
during any 12-month period individuals who were directors of the Company at  the
beginning  of  the  period  cease  to constitute  a  majority  of  the  board of
directors.
   Interest on borrowings under  the Credit Agreements  would be determined,  at
the  Company&#39;s option, by (a)  an auction bidding procedure;  (b) the highest of
the average floating base rate of two reference banks, 0.5% above the average CD
rate, or 0.5% above the Federal funds rate; or (c) a spread (equal to 21.25  and
23.25  basis points for the 3 Year  and 364 Day Credit Agreements, respectively,
and if either  Credit Agreement  is drawn  down in excess  of 50%  of its  total
amount, 27.5 and 29.5 basis points for the 3 Year and 364 Day Credit Agreements,
respectively)  over the average LIBOR  or CD rate of  three reference banks. The
spreads over the LIBOR or  CD rates are subject to  increase or decrease if  the
Company&#39;s  long-term debt ratings change. The Company had no balance outstanding
under the Credit  Agreements at December  31, 1994. The  Credit Agreements  have
served  as support for the issuance of commercial paper and certain notes issued
under the Company&#39;s Employee Stock  Ownership Plan funding program. At  December
31,  1994, the Company  had outstanding $217  million of notes  supported by the
Credit Agreements.

NOTE 16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The  Company, as a result  of its global operating  and financing activities, is
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates,  which
may  adversely  affect its  results of  operations  and financial  condition. In
seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities,  the
Company  manages  exposure to  changes in  interest  rates and  foreign currency
exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities and,  when
deemed  appropriate, through  the use  of derivative  financial instruments. The
instruments utilized include  forward, option and  swap agreements. The  Company
does  not use financial  instruments for trading  or other speculative purposes.
The Company had no leveraged financial instruments at December 31, 1994.
   At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company held interest rate swap agreements
maturing through  1999. At  December  31, 1994,  interest rate  swap  agreements
effectively  changed $82  million of London  Interbank Offer  Rate (LIBOR) based
floating rate debt (average  5.21%) to fixed rate  debt (average 7.12%)  thereby
reducing  the potential  impact of increasing  short-term interest  rates on the
Company&#39;s results  of  operations. At  December  31, 1993,  interest  rate  swap
agreements  effectively changed $373 million of  fixed rate debt (average 9.66%)
to LIBOR based  floating rate debt  (average 5.3%), $82  million of LIBOR  based
floating  rate debt (average 3.11%) to fixed rate debt (average 7.24%) and a $41
million fixed rate obligation (7.5%) to a LIBOR floating rate obligation (3.5%).
   The Company&#39;s exposure to changes  in foreign currency exchange rates  arises
from  inter-company loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries, receivables,
payables and  firm  commitments  arising from  international  transactions.  The
Company  attempts to  have all such  transaction exposures  hedged with internal
natural offsets to  the fullest  extent possible and,  once these  opportunities
have been exhausted, through derivative financial instruments with third parties
(i.e., forward or option agreements). The Company currently also uses derivative
financial  instruments to  hedge the  Company&#39;s exposure  to changes  in foreign
currency exchange rates for the translated  U.S. dollar value of the net  income
of  a number of  foreign subsidiaries. The  Company&#39;s principal foreign currency
exposures relate to  the French  franc, the  German deutsche  mark, the  British
pound  and the U.S. dollar.  At December 31, 1994 and  1993, the Company held or
had written foreign  currency forward  and option  agreements, maturing  through
1997.  The Company uses some of these  agreements to reduce exposures to changes
in foreign currency  exchange rates  and to reduce  the risk  that such  changes
would  adversely affect  its results  of operations  or financial  condition. In
addition, some of these instruments are hedges of firmly committed  transactions
and forecasted transactions that will or are expected to occur through 1995.
   The  Company&#39;s financial instrument counterparties are substantial investment
or commercial  banks  with significant  experience  with such  instruments.  The
Company  manages exposure to  counterparty credit risk  through specific minimum
credit  standards  and  diversification  of  counterparties.  The  Company   has
procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts. The Company believes that the
credit  risks, in part  because of the  above practices and  procedures, are not
significant. At December 31, 1994 the  net market risk exposures from  financial
instruments were not significant.
   The  values of the Company&#39;s  outstanding derivative financial instruments at
December 31, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:

   The only other material financial instruments that are  not  carried  in  the
Consolidated  Balance Sheet at amounts which approximate fair values are certain
debt instruments.  The carrying  value  of long-term  debt and  related  current
maturities (excluding capitalized leases of $47 and $52 million at year-end 1994
and  1993, respectively)  is $1,507  and $1,687  million and  the fair  value is
$1,590 and $1,945 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The  fair
values are estimated based on the quoted market price for the issues (if traded)
or  based on current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturity and characteristics.
 
NOTE 17. CAPITAL STOCK

NOTE 18. STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS
 
The  Company has  a 1993  Stock Plan and  a 1985  Stock Plan  available to grant
options and other related benefits to  employees. Under both plans, the  Company
may  grant incentive and non-qualified  stock options, stock appreciation rights
(SARs), restricted shares  and restricted  units (Units) to  officers and  other
employees.  SARs entitle an optionee to  surrender unexercised stock options for
cash or stock equal to  the excess of the fair  market value of the  surrendered
shares  over the option value  of such shares. The  1993 Stock Plan provides for
the annual grant  of awards  in an amount  not in  excess of 1.5%  of the  total
shares  issued (including shares  held in treasury)  on December 31  of the year
preceding the year of the award. Any  shares that are available for awards  that
are  not utilized in a given year will be available for use in subsequent years.
Units have  been granted  to  certain employees,  which  entitle the  holder  to
receive  shares of common stock. At December 31, 1994 there were 1,206,109 Units
outstanding, including 428,680 Units granted in 1994, the restrictions on  which
generally  lapse  over periods  not  exceeding nine  years  from date  of grant.
Incentive stock options have a term determined by the Management Development and
Compensation Committee of the  Board (the Committee), but  not in excess of  ten
years.  Non-qualified stock options  have been granted  with terms of  up to ten
years and one  day. An  option becomes  exercisable at  such times  and in  such
installments  as set by the Committee. Options generally become exercisable over
a three-year period.

   The Company  also has  a Stock  Plan for  Non-Employee Directors  (Directors)
under  which restricted shares and options are  granted. Prior to April 25, 1994
Directors received  one-time grants  of 3,000  shares of  common stock  and  new
Directors  after that date will receive grants  of 1,500 shares of common stock,
subject to certain restrictions. In addition,  each Director will be granted  an
option  to purchase 1,000  shares of common stock  each year on  the date of the
annual meeting of  shareowners. The  Company has  set aside  225,000 shares  for
issuance  under  the stock  plan. Options  generally  become exercisable  over a
three-year period and have a term of ten years.
   All options were  granted at  not less  than fair  market value  at dates  of
grant.
   Treasury  shares  of  common stock  have  been  used upon  exercise  of stock
options. Differences  between the  cost of  treasury stock  used and  the  total
option price of shares exercised have been reflected in retained earnings.

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
The  Company is subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some
of which  involve  substantial  amounts)  arising out  of  the  conduct  of  its
business,  including  those  relating  to  commercial  transactions,  government
contracts, product liability and environmental,  safety and health matters.  One
such  lawsuit was brought by  The B. F. Goodrich  Company (Goodrich) in the U.S.
District Court for Delaware alleging infringement by the Company of two  patents
relating
 
34
 &lt;PAGE&gt;

to  aircraft brakes  and seeking injunctive  relief and  damages. The allegation
against the Company related only  to brakes for the Boeing  777, which is to  be
introduced in 1995, and not to any other brake program of the Company. At trial,
Goodrich  claimed  damages of  approximately  $350 million  before  trebling. On
November 10, 1994, after a  full trial on the  merits, the District Court  ruled
the  Goodrich patents were invalid, turned down Goodrich&#39;s claim for damages and
denied its request  for an  injunction. On December  8, 1994,  Goodrich filed  a
notice  that it would  appeal this decision. The  Company believes that Goodrich
will not prevail on appeal.
   In accordance with  the Company&#39;s accounting  policy described in  Note 1  of
Notes  to  Financial  Statements,  liabilities  are  recorded  for environmental
matters generally on the completion of feasibility studies or the settlement  of
claims, but in no event later than the Company&#39;s commitment to a plan of action.
Although  the  Company  does  not currently  possess  sufficient  information to
reasonably estimate the amounts  of the liabilities to  be recorded upon  future
completion  of studies, they  may be significant to  the consolidated results of
operations, but  management does  not  expect that  they  will have  a  material
adverse  effect  on the  consolidated financial  position  of the  Company. With
respect to all  other matters,  while the  ultimate results  of these  lawsuits,
investigations  and claims cannot be determined, management does not expect that
these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position of the Company.
   The Company  has  issued  or  is  a party  to  various  direct  and  indirect
guarantees,  bank letters of credit and customer guarantees. Management does not
expect these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on the  consolidated
results of operations or financial position of the Company.
 
NOTE 21. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND OTHER INFORMATION
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid
debt  instruments  with  maturities  generally of  three  months  or  less. Cash
payments during the years  1994, 1993 and 1992  included interest of $121,  $180
and $241 million and income taxes of $164, $130 and $115 million, respectively.
   In  November 1994 the  Company and General Motors  Corporation formed a joint
venture to manufacture coated substrates  for catalytic converters. The  Company
contributed  its environmental catalysts business and General Motors contributed
other assets and a long-term sales contract to the venture. The transaction  had
the following non-cash impact on the Company&#39;s 1994 balance sheet:

   In  October 1993 the Company and Knorr-Bremse  AG formed an alliance to which
both companies contributed  their European operations,  which provide  air-brake
controls  and related products to the heavy truck industry. The Company owns 35%
of the venture, and  Knorr-Bremse owns the balance  and manages the  operations.
The  transaction had the following non-cash impact on the Company&#39;s 1993 balance

   The weighted average  interest rate on  short-term borrowings and  commercial
paper  outstanding  at  December  31,  1994  and  1993  was  11.21%  and  9.12%,
respectively.
 
NOTE 22. OIL AND GAS INVESTMENT
 
During 1992 the  Company disposed of  its remaining investments  in Union  Texas
Petroleum  Holdings,  Inc. (Union  Texas)  resulting in  a  pretax gain  of $357
million (after-tax  $221  million,  or  $0.78 a  share).  The  Company  received
approximately  $585 million, after underwriters&#39;  discount, from the disposition
of its approximate 39% interest in the common stock of Union Texas. In addition,
the Company received  $355 million  from the redemption  at face  value of  $200
million  of preferred shares  and $155 million  of warrants of  Union Texas. The
Company received dividends from its preferred  investment in Union Texas of  $30
million in 1992.
 
NOTE 23. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER
THAN PENSIONS
 
The  Company&#39;s U.S.  retiree medical  programs cover  employees who  retire with
pension eligibility  for  hospital,  professional  and  other  medical  services
(programs).  Most  of  the  programs  require  deductibles  and  copayments  and
virtually all are integrated with Medicare. Retiree contributions are  generally
required based on coverage type, plan and Medicare eligibility. The Company also
sponsors  retiree life insurance programs which generally provide a flat benefit
of at least two thousand dollars or a  benefit as a percent of pay. The  retiree
medical and life insurance programs are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid
from the general assets of the Company.
   For  most non-union  employees retiring after  July 1, 1992,  the Company has
implemented an  approach  which  bases the  Company&#39;s  contribution  to  retiree
medical  premiums on  years of  service and  also establishes  a maximum Company
contribution in the future at approximately twice the current level at the  date
of implementation.
   In  1994, 1993 and 1992 the Company&#39;s cost for providing other postretirement
benefits aggregated $150,  $153 and  $166 million,  respectively, excluding  the
cumulative  pretax impact  of adopting  FASB No. 106  in 1992  of $1,790 million
(after-tax $1,099 million, or $3.90 a  share). The Company uses the services  of
an enrolled actuary to calculate postretirement benefit costs.
   For  measurement purposes,  the assumed  annual rate  of increase  in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits  was 11% for 1994, which reduces  to
6% in 2000 and remains at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate
assumption  has a  significant effect  on the  amounts reported.  To illustrate,
increasing the assumed  health care cost  trend rates by  1 percentage point  in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December
 
                                                                              35
 &lt;PAGE&gt;

31,  1994 by  $116 million and  the aggregate  of the service  and interest cost
component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by
$11  million.  The  weighted-average  discount  rate  used  in  determining  the

NOTE 24. PENSIONS
 
The Company&#39;s pension plans, most of which are defined benefit plans and  almost
all  of which are  noncontributory, cover substantially  all employees. Benefits
under the plans are generally provided based on years of service and  employees&#39;
compensation  during the last years  of employment or as  a flat dollar benefit.
Benefits are generally paid from funds  previously provided to trustees. In  the
Company&#39;s  principal U.S. plans, funds are contributed to a trustee as necessary
to provide for current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation
over a  reasonable period.  To  the extent  that  these requirements  are  fully
covered  by assets  on hand  for a  plan, a  contribution may  not be  made in a
particular year. As  of year-end 1994  approximately 56% of  the assets of  U.S.
plans  were  held in  equity  securities, with  the  balance primarily  in fixed
income-type securities.
   Pension expense  in 1994,  1993 and  1992 was  $109, $104  and $102  million,
respectively.  The Company uses the services of an enrolled actuary to calculate
the amount  of pension  expense and  contributions to  trustees of  the  various
pension plans.
 
   Net  periodic pension  cost for  1994, 1993  and 1992  included the following

   The assumed rate  of return for  the Company&#39;s U.S.  defined benefit  pension
plans  was  9%  in  1994, 1993  and  1992.  The assumed  discount  rate  used in
calculating the projected  benefit obligations  at December 31,  1994, 1993  and
1992  was 8.75%, 7.25% and 8.25%,  respectively. In addition, the assumed annual
increase in compensation over employees&#39;  estimated remaining working lives  was
5% in 1994 and 5.5% for both 1993 and 1992.

To the Shareowners and Directors
of AlliedSignal Inc.
 
In our  opinion, the  accompanying consolidated  balance sheet  and the  related
consolidated  statements  of  income, of  retained  earnings and  of  cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AlliedSignal
Inc. and its  subsidiaries at December  31, 1994  and 1993, and  the results  of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December  31,  1994,  in conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  These financial statements are  the responsibility of the Company&#39;s
management; our  responsibility is  to  express an  opinion on  these  financial
statements  based on our audits. We conducted  our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on  a
test  basis, evidence  supporting the amounts  and disclosures  in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting  principles used and significant  estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 23 to the financial statements, the Company  changed
its  methods of  accounting for postemployment  benefits in 1993  and for income
taxes and postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1992.

<h3 id="Jaccard-Similarity">Jaccard Similarity<a class="anchor-link" href="#Jaccard-Similarity">&#182;</a></h3><p>Using the bag of words, let's calculate the jaccard similarity on the bag of words and plot it over time. Implement <code>get_jaccard_similarity</code> to return the jaccard similarities between each tick in time. Since the input, <code>bag_of_words_matrix</code>, is a bag of words for each time period in order, you just need to compute the jaccard similarities for each neighboring bag of words. Make sure to turn the bag of words into a boolean array when calculating the jaccard similarity.</p>

<h3 id="Cosine-Similarity">Cosine Similarity<a class="anchor-link" href="#Cosine-Similarity">&#182;</a></h3><p>Using the TFIDF values, we'll calculate the cosine similarity and plot it over time. Implement <code>get_cosine_similarity</code> to return the cosine similarities between each tick in time. Since the input, <code>tfidf_matrix</code>, is a TFIDF vector for each time period in order, you just need to computer the cosine similarities for each neighboring vector.</p>

<h3 id="Turnover-Analysis">Turnover Analysis<a class="anchor-link" href="#Turnover-Analysis">&#182;</a></h3><p>Without doing a full and formal backtest, we can analyze how stable the alphas are over time. Stability in this sense means that from period to period, the alpha ranks do not change much. Since trading is costly, we always prefer, all other things being equal, that the ranks do not change significantly per period. We can measure this with the <strong>Factor Rank Autocorrelation (FRA)</strong>.</p>
